<p class="pin">THIS is not a work of compromises, or of conjectural
interpretations of the sacred Scriptures, neither is it a
paraphrase, but a strict literal rendering. It neither adds nor
takes away; but aims to express the original with the utmost
clearness, and force, and with the utmost precision. It adopts,
however, except in the prayers, a thoroughly modern style, and makes
freely whatever changes are necessary for this purpose.</p>
<p class="pin">Besides being a contribution to Biblical science, it
is designed to be a still more important contribution to practical
religion, for which the Bible in its original languages and in all
its translations is chiefly valuable. The translation depends
mainly on its superior adaptation to this end, under the blessing
of God, for its success and usefulness. If it shall be found on
trial to be a superior instrument of piety and virtue, it will
doubtless meet with favor and do good. The ascendency of practical
religion is not so general or complete, that any additional help
for its promotion can be deemed unnecessary.</p>
<p class="pin">New translations of the Scriptures are generally
introduced with apologies and received with caution and distrust.
In many cases men have resisted them as dangerous innovations, and
attempted to exterminate them with fire and sword. This was the
case with the translations of Wickliffe and of Tindal. But truth
and the kind providence of God were too mighty for their enemies,
and these translations lived to see their persecutors in the dust,
and to laugh them to scorn. Wickliffe's translation was published
in 1380, in a dark age. Many good men anticipated from it the
greatest calamities, and resisted it with the most intemperate
zeal, and every species of denunciation was used against it. It was
made from the Vulgate, and not from the Greek and Hebrew, and was
imperfect; but it was a great improvement on what existed before,
and it proved a great blessing.</p>
<p class="pin">Tindal was contemporary with Luther, and undertook
to give a new translation of the Bible to England, as Luther did to
Germany. He completed his New Testament against the greatest
opposition, and published it in 1526, and was engaged on the Old
Testament, when he was arrested, imprisoned a year, and then
brought to the stake and strangled and burnt, at the age of
fifty-nine, A.D. 1536. He was the morning star of the Reformation
in England, and became by his translation of the New Testament and
a part of the Old, and by the interest he excited in the subject of
improved translations in England, one of the great benefactors of
his race. He was a man of great gentleness, kindness, simplicity of
character, and benevolence, and his life is without a stain.
Coverdale translated the whole Bible, and published it in 1535
while Tindal was in prison waiting for his crown of martyrdom.
Several other translations followed, and that of King James last of
all, in 1611.</p>
<p class="pin">King James's translation was made by forty-seven
translators, divided into six companies, and laboring on their work
three years. The Douay Bible was first translated and published
complete in 1609, almost simultaneously with the Bible of King
James. It has the disadvantage of having been made from the Latin
Vulgate, and not directly from the original Greek and Hebrew, but
is a valuable version, and like the Bible of King James, is one of
the great monuments of the times which produced it, as well as of
the church which has adhered to it. It is good but not perfect; and
it is hoped that its friends will not be unwilling to accept an
improvement.</p>
<p class="pin">From the publication of Wickliffe's Bible in 1380,
to that of Tindal's New Testament in 1526, was one hundred and
forty-six years. From the publication of Tindal's New Testament in
1526, to that of King James's Bible in 1611, was eighty-five years.
There was considerable progress made in knowledge, and the English
language was considerably changed, in the interval of one hundred
and forty-six years between the publication of Wickliffe's Bible
and Tindal's New Testament. There was also considerable progress in
knowledge, and some changes were made in the English language, in
the interval of eighty-five years between the publication of
Tindal's New Testament and King James's Bible.</p>
<p class="pin">The period that has elapsed between the publication
of King James's Bible in 1611 and the present time (1858) is two
hundred and forty-seven years, sixteen years more than the entire
period from the publication of Wickliffe's Bible in 1380 to that of
King James's in 1611. Besides, this has been a period of
unparalleled activity in the investigation of Biblical subjects,
and the prosecution of Biblical studies. Two hundred and
forty-seven years, reckoning, thirty-three years to a generation,
are seven generations and a half; and these seven generations and a
half have been engaged in Biblical studies with unprecedented
diligence and success, making great improvements in the text,
detecting numerous interpolations and errors, making great
improvements in the rendering, and detecting numerous errors in it;
but the almost exclusive Bible of common life, of the family, the
school, the church, and of private and devotional reading and
study, with English Protestants, is still the Bible of King James,
with its errors uncorrected, its interpolations unremoved, and its
defects unsupplied.</p>
<p class="pin">Several new translations have been made since King
James's time, but none of them have as yet been received with any
considerable favor. King James's Bible, though extravagantly
eulogized, was an excellent version for the times that produced it;
yet it made much less improvement on the Bishop's Bible, the Geneva
Bible, and Tindal's, Coverdale's, and others which it superseded,
than Tindal's and Coverdale's did on Wickliffe's. Tindal, in the
face of constant persecution, and cut off from many of the
advantages and facilities which in more auspicious times he might
have enjoyed, did more for the English Bible than all King James's
translators. So did Luther for the Bible in Germany.</p>
<p class="pin">It is an unfortunate result of King James's
translation of the Bible by an imposing council of learned men,
that it has tended to discourage individual effort in respect to a
labor of this kind, and to create a prejudice against it as
necessarily incompetent and untrustworthy. Societies and councils
have their spheres in which they are useful; yet they often
transcend them and intrude on those of individuals. But there are
great works which individuals can perform better than multitudes or
councils. Councils did not make the Bible at first. It was made by
individuals, each man acting for himself, and giving utterance to
the mighty thoughts that God had given him. A council did not make
Paradise Lost, and could not; nor has a council ever produced any
immortal work of genius or learning, unless it is the English Bible
of King James. With this exception, these are all the works of
individuals. As individuals, therefore, have generally been the
prosecutors of literary enterprises, in the department of Bible
translation no less than in other departments, and as individuals
have been eminently successful and useful in this department of
labor heretofore, both in England and other countries, let it be
hoped that they may be again.</p>
<p class="pin">There is a vast accumulation of knowledge to be made
available by some one, or in some way, for the production of an
improved English Bible, that shall bear the same relation to the
advanced knowledge of these times, which Tindal's, Coverdale's, and
that of King James did to theirs. More study has been expended on
the sacred text and its interpretation, and more progress made in
Biblical knowledge in the last seven generations, than in all time
before. This knowledge is treasured up in critical editions of the
original Scriptures, critical commentaries on them in Latin and
other languages, in Greek and Hebrew Lexicons, and in other works
in the various departments of Biblical learning, embracing
commentaries on the English Scriptures, several of which are
extensive and valuable. No man can gainsay them, no man can
disparage them. They are monuments of the most precious and
valuable learning of their times. Scholars with ample means and
ample time for critical research, and those whose tastes and
professions and convictions of duty incline them in that direction,
may in a long series of years become masters of much of this
learning, and receive the benefit of it. A few are masters of it,
but how few! But how are the people to obtain it? When are they to
find the time to obtain it? Where are they to find the means? The
clergy are the instructors of the people on sacred subjects.
Biblical learning is a part of their profession. They study it by
day and by night, from youth to old age; but how are the great mass
of clergymen even, amidst their parish cares and homiletical
labors, and with their limited means and restricted libraries, to
obtain much of this knowledge? Some of it they may obtain, but much
of it they will not, and cannot.</p>
<p class="pin">The only way in which the vast stores of Biblical
learning accumulated during the last two hundred and forty-seven
years, by the labors of seven and a half generations toiling in
succession, each generation beginning where that which preceded it
left off, and each adding something to the stock which it received,
can become available for the general benefit of the people, is by
an improved text and translation of the Bible, into which, as far
as possible, they shall all be brought, and to the perfection of
which they shall contribute. This is the task which has been
undertaken in the present work, and with what degree of success,
the public will judge. The text which has been followed in this
translation, is that of Tischendorf, published at Leipsic in 1850.
It is not only a great improvement on the received text, but on the
critical texts that are in general use in this country. Tischendorf
follows Griesbach, Lachman and others, and availing himself of
their labors, together with his own accurate collations of
manuscripts extending to nearly all the most ancient manuscripts in
the world, and following in the steps of Lachman by editing solely
from ancient authority, has brought the text of the New Testament
to a degree of perfection not anticipated or even hoped for in past
ages. It is a high recommendation of this translation, and will
command for it an additional respect from all competent judges,
that it follows this highly improved text. Readers will be able by
this to see what is the Bible and what is not. It is not claimed
for the text of Tischendorf that it is perfect; no text can be; but
it is claimed for it, that it retains no known interpolation in the
sacred books, and omits nothing known to belong to them. Future
laborers will doubtless make some improvements on the text of
Tischendorf, as he has done on that of Lachman; but they cannot be
expected to change it essentially.</p>
<p class="pin">I have deviated from Tischendorf in omitting Jesus
as the proper name of Barabbas in two instances in Matt. xxv. 4,
and occasionally in punctuation, and have retained two important
interpolations in the text, duly noted as such, Mark, xvii. and
John, x. 8.</p>
<p class="pin">The recent work of Trench on the English Bible came
to hand after considerable progress had been made in stereotyping
this volume. The translator was highly gratified to find that
nearly all the improvements and corrections suggested by that
eminent scholar were already made in this work, together with many
others.</p>
<p class="pin">The arrangement of the books and divisions of the
chapters and verses in this Translation are believed to be great
improvements on those in common use. As such they are commended to
the attention of translators and editors in different languages,
and it is hoped will be found satisfactory.</p>
<p class="pin">The chronology of the New Testament is involved in
great obscurity. The Christian Era was first proposed by Dionysius
Exiguus, about A.D. 550, and was gradually adopted in the seventh
and eighth centuries. By a mistake of Dionysius it was made to
commence from four to six years too late. The birth of Christ was
from 4 to 6 B.C.; his baptism, in the fifteenth year of Tiberius,
A.D. 24; his death, probably, A.D. 28; and the events recorded in
the first part of Acts prior to the death of Herod, A.D. 44,
occurred considerably earlier than the dates usually assigned to
them.</p>
<p class="pin">Matthew and Luke probably wrote their gospels A.D.
62 or 63; Mark and John, theirs A.D. 65-68. Acts was written A.D.
63. All the books of the New Testament were probably written before
the destruction of Jerusalem, in the interval of seventeen years
from A.D. 53 to 70.</p>
<p class="pin">The author of Revelation bears the same name as one
of the Evangelists. But this does not prove that he was the same
person, neither is the church tradition on the subject entitled to
undoubted confidence. The author of Revelation does not claim to be
an apostle; and by not making that claim in a book so
extraordinary, virtually teaches that he is not such. His style
also presents points of diversity from that of the Evangelist, that
seem to be incompatible with the supposition that the same author
wrote both works.</p>
<p class="pin">With these few explanations I commend this volume to
the acceptance and blessing of our kind Father in heaven, and send
it forth, accompanied with many prayers, to call men from sin to
holiness, and from death and sorrow to the only true life and
joy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>
<h3>THE GENEALOGY AND BIRTH OF CHRIST.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">1:1</sup>AN account of the birth
of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. <sup class=
"v">1:2</sup>Abraham begat Isaac, and Isaac begat Jacob, and Jacob
begat Judah and his brothers; <sup class="v">1:3</sup>and Judah
begat Pharez and Zarah by Thamar; and Pharez begat Hezron, and
Hezron begat Ram, <sup class="v">1:4</sup>and Ram begat Aminadab,
and Aminadab begat Nashon, and Nashon begat Salmon, <sup class=
"v">1:5</sup>and Salmon begat Boaz by Rahab, and Boaz begat Obed by
Ruth, and Obed begat Jesse, <sup class="v">1:6</sup>and Jesse begat
David the king.</p>
<p class="pin">2 And David begat Solomon by the wife of Uriah,
<sup class="v">1:7</sup>and Solomon begat Rehoboam, and Rehoboam
begat Abijah, and Abijah begat Asa, <sup class="v">1:8</sup>and Asa
begat Jehoshaphat, and Jehoshaphat begat Jehoram, and Jehoram begat
Uzziah, <sup class="v">1:9</sup>and Uzziah begat Jotham, and Jotham
begat Ahaz, and Ahaz begat Hezekiah, <sup class="v">1:10</sup>and
Hezekiah begat Manassah, and Manassah begat Amon, and Amon begat
Josiah, <sup class="v">1:11</sup>and Josiah begat Jechoniah and his
brothers at the Babylonian exile.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">1:12</sup>After the Babylonian
exile, Jechoniah begat Shealtiel, and Shealtiel begat Zerubabel,
<sup class="v">1:13</sup>and Zerubabel begat Abiud, and Abiud begat
Eliakim, and Eliakim begat Azar, <sup class="v">1:14</sup>and Azar
begat Zadoc, and Zadoc begat Achim, and Achim begat Eliud,
<sup class="v">1:15</sup>and Eliud begat Eleazar, and Eleazar begat
Matthan, and Matthan begat Jacob, <sup class="v">1:16</sup>and
Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus,
called Christ. <sup class="v">1:17</sup>All the generations
therefore, from Abraham to David, are fourteen generations; and
from David to the Babylonian exile, fourteen generations; and from
the Babylonian exile to the Christ, fourteen generations.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">1:18</sup>The birth of Christ was
thus. His mother Mary having been espoused to Joseph, before they
came together, was found to be with child by the Holy Spirit.
<sup class="v">1:19</sup>But Joseph her husband being a righteous
man, and not wishing to make her an example, was designing to put
her away privately. <sup class="v">1:20</sup>But while he was
thinking of these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to
him in a dream, saying, Joseph, son of David, fear not to take Mary
your wife, for that which is conceived in her is by the Holy
Spirit, <sup class="v">1:21</sup>and she shall bear a son, and you
shall call his name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their
sins.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">1:22</sup>But all this was done,
that the word of the Lord might be fulfilled which was spoken by
the prophet, saying; <sup class="v">1:23</sup>Behold, the virgin
shall be with child, and shall bear a son, and they shall call his
name Emmanuel; which is interpreted, God is with us. <sup class=
"v">1:24</sup>And when Joseph awoke from his sleep, he did as the
angel of the Lord had commanded him, and took his wife, <sup class=
"v">1:25</sup>and knew her not till she bore a son, and he called
his name Jesus.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<h3>THE INFANCY OF CHRIST.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">2:1</sup>AND Jesus being born in
Bethlehem in Judea, in the days of Herod the king, behold Magi came
from the East to Jerusalem, saying, <sup class="v">2:2</sup>Where
is the king of the Jews born? For we have seen his star in the
East, and have come to worship him. <sup class="v">2:3</sup>And
Herod the king hearing this was troubled, and all Jerusalem with
him; <sup class="v">2:4</sup>and assembling all the chief priests
and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Christ is
born. <sup class="v">2:5</sup>And they said to him, In Bethlehem of
Judea; for thus it is written by the prophet; <sup class=
"v">2:6</sup>And you Bethlehem, land of Judah, are by no means
least among the governors of Judah, for out of you shall come a
governor who shall rule my people Israel.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">2:7</sup>Then Herod, calling the
Magi secretly, asked them the precise time when the star appeared;
<sup class="v">2:8</sup>and sending them to Bethlehem, said, Go and
inquire diligently for the young child, and when you have found
him, tell me, that I also may come and worship him. <sup class=
"v">2:9</sup>And hearing the king, they departed; and behold, the
star which they saw in the East went before them, till it came and
stood over where the young child was. <sup class="v">2:10</sup>And
seeing the star they rejoiced with great joy; <sup class=
"v">2:11</sup>and coming into the house they saw the young child
with Mary his mother; and they fell down and worshipped him; and
opening their treasures they presented him gifts, gold, and
frankincense, and myrrh. <sup class="v">2:12</sup>And being
divinely instructed in a dream not to return to Herod, they
departed to their country another way.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">2:13</sup>And when they had
departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a
dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and
flee into Egypt, and remain there till I tell you; for Herod will
seek the young child to destroy it. <sup class="v">2:14</sup>And he
arose and took the young child and his mother by night, and fled
into Egypt, <sup class="v">2:15</sup>and was there till the death
of Herod; that the word might be fulfilled, which the Lord spoke by
the prophet, saying; Out of Egypt have I called my son.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">2:16</sup>Then Herod seeing that
he was despised by the Magi, was exceedingly angry, and sent and
destroyed all the children in Bethlehem, and in all its borders,
from two years old and under, according to the precise time which
he had learned of the Magi. <sup class="v">2:17</sup>Thus was
fulfilled the word spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying;
<sup class="v">2:18</sup>A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation
and great mourning; Rachel weeping for her children, and would not
be comforted because they were not.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">2:19</sup>And when Herod had
died, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream,
in Egypt, saying, <sup class="v">2:20</sup>Arise, and take the
young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel; for
they are dead that sought the young child's life. <sup class=
"v">2:21</sup>And he arose and took the young child and his mother,
and went into the land of Israel. <sup class="v">2:22</sup>But
hearing that Archelaus reigned over Judea in the place of Herod his
father, he was afraid to go there; but being divinely instructed in
a dream, he departed into the parts of Galilee, <sup class=
"v">2:23</sup>and went and lived in a city called Nazareth, that
the word spoken by the prophets might be fulfilled, He shall be
called a Nazoraean.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST'S BAPTISM AND TEMPTATION.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">3:1</sup>AND in those days came
John the Baptist preaching in the wilderness of Judea, saying,
<sup class="v">3:2</sup>Change your minds, for the kingdom of
Heaven is at hand. <sup class="v">3:3</sup>For this is he that was
spoken of by Isaiah the prophet, saying; A voice of one crying in
the wilderness, Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths
straight. <sup class="v">3:4</sup>And this John had his clothes of
camel's hair, and a leather girdle about his loins, and his food
was locusts and wild honey. <sup class="v">3:5</sup>Then went out
to him Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all the region about the
Jordan, <sup class="v">3:6</sup>and were baptized by him in the
river Jordan, confessing their sins.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">3:7</sup>And seeing many of the
Pharisees and Sadducees come for the baptism, he said to them;
Offspring of vipers, who has warned you to flee from the wrath to
come? <sup class="v">3:8</sup>Bear fruit, therefore, worthy of a
change of mind; <sup class="v">3:9</sup>and think not to say within
yourselves, We have Abraham for a father; for I tell you that God
is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham;
<sup class="v">3:10</sup>and already the axe lies at the root of
the trees; every tree, therefore, which bears not good fruit is cut
down and cast into the fire. <sup class="v">3:11</sup>I indeed
baptize you with water to a change of mind; but he that comes after
me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not fit to bear; he shall
baptize you with the Holy Spirit, and fire; <sup class=
"v">3:12</sup>whose winnowing shovel is in his hand, and he will
thoroughly clean his threshing floor, and gather his wheat into the
storehouse; but the chaff he will burn with an inextinguishable
fire.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">3:13</sup>Then came Jesus from
Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him. <sup class=
"v">3:14</sup>But, he refused him, saying, I have need to be
baptized by you, and do you come to me? <sup class=
"v">3:15</sup>But Jesus answered and said to him, Suffer me now;
for thus, it becomes us to complete all righteousness. Then he
suffered him; <sup class="v">3:16</sup>and Jesus being baptized
went up immediately from the water, and behold, the heavens were
opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descend like a dove and come
upon him. <sup class="v">3:17</sup>And behold, a voice from the
heavens, saying, This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well
pleased.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">4:1</sup>Then Jesus was led up by
the Spirit into the wilderness, to be tempted by the devil.
<sup class="v">4:2</sup>And having fasted forty days and forty
nights, he was afterwards hungry. <sup class="v">4:3</sup>And the
tempter came and said to him, If you are the Son of God, command
these stones to become bread. <sup class="v">4:4</sup>And he
answered and said; It is written, man shall not live by bread
alone, but by every word which proceeds from the mouth of God.
<sup class="v">4:5</sup>Then the devil took him into the holy city,
and placed him on the pinnacle of the temple, <sup class=
"v">4:6</sup>and said to him, If you are the Son of God, cast
yourself down; for it is written, He shall give his angels charge
concerning you, and they shall take you up on their hands, lest at
any time you dash your foot against a stone. <sup class=
"v">4:7</sup>Jesus said to him, Again it is written, You shall not
try the Lord your God. <sup class="v">4:8</sup>Again the devil took
him away on a very high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms
of the world, and their glory, <sup class="v">4:9</sup>and said to
him, All these things will I give you, if you will fall down and
worship me. <sup class="v">4:10</sup>Then Jesus said to him, Get
behind me Satan; for it is written, You shall worship the Lord your
God, and him only shall you serve. <sup class="v">4:11</sup>Then
the devil left him; and behold angels came and waited on him.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST COMMENCING HIS PUBLIC MINISTRY.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">4:12</sup>AND when he heard that
John was delivered up, he departed to Galilee; <sup class=
"v">4:13</sup>and leaving Nazareth he came and lived at Capernaum
on the lake, in the bounds of Zebulon and Naphtali, <sup class=
"v">4:14</sup>that the word might be fulfilled, spoken by Isaiah
the prophet, saying; <sup class="v">4:15</sup>Land of Zebulon and
Naphtali, by the way of the lake, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the
nations, <sup class="v">4:16</sup>the people who sat in darkness
have seen a great light, and upon those who sat in the region and
shade of death has light arisen. <sup class="v">4:17</sup>From that
time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Change your minds; for the
kingdom of heaven is at hand.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">4:18</sup>And walking by the lake
of Galilee he saw two brothers, Simon, called Peter, and Andrew his
brother, casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.
<sup class="v">4:19</sup>And he said to them, Come after me, and I
will make you fishermen of men. <sup class="v">4:20</sup>And they
left their nets, immediately, and followed him. <sup class=
"v">4:21</sup>And going forward thence, he saw two other brothers,
James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, in the ship with
Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.
<sup class="v">4:22</sup>And they immediately left the ship and
their father, and followed him.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">4:23</sup>And he went about in
all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news
of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every infirmity among
the people. <sup class="v">4:24</sup>And his fame went out into all
Syria; and they brought him all that were ill, afflicted with
various diseases and torments, and demoniacs, and lunatics, and
paralytics, and he cured them; <sup class="v">4:25</sup>and great
multitudes followed him from Galilee, and Decapolis, and Jerusalem,
and Judea, and beyond the Jordan.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST'S SERMON ON THE MOUNT.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">5:1</sup>AND seeing the
multitudes, he went on the mountain and sat down; and his disciples
came to him. <sup class="v">5:2</sup>And he opened his mouth and
taught them, saying; <sup class="v">5:3</sup>Blessed are the poor
in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. <sup class=
"v">5:5</sup>Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the
earth. <sup class="v">5:4</sup>Blessed are those that mourn, for
they shall be comforted. <sup class="v">5:6</sup>Blessed are those
that hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be filled.
<sup class="v">5:7</sup>Blessed are the merciful, for they shall
obtain mercy. <sup class="v">5:8</sup>Blessed are the pure in
heart, for they shall see God. <sup class="v">5:9</sup>Blessed are
the peace makers, for they shall be called children of God.
<sup class="v">5:10</sup>Blessed are the persecuted for
righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. <sup class=
"v">5:11</sup>Blessed are you when they shall reproach you, and
persecute you, and say every evil against you, falsely, for my
sake. <sup class="v">5:12</sup>Rejoice and exult, for great is your
reward in heaven; for so persecuted they the prophets who were
before you.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">5:13</sup>You are the salt of the
earth; but if the salt has lost its strength, with what shall it be
seasoned? It is good for nothing more, except being cast out to be
trodden upon by men. <sup class="v">5:14</sup>You are the light of
the world. A city situated on a mountain cannot be hid. <sup class=
"v">5:15</sup>Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a
modius [1.916 gallon measure], but on a candlestick, and it shines
to all in the house. <sup class="v">5:16</sup>Let your light so
shine before men that they may see your good works, and glorify
your father in heaven. <sup class="v">5:17</sup>Think not that I
have come to destroy the law or the prophets; I have not come to
destroy but to complete. <sup class="v">5:18</sup>For I tell you
truly, that till heaven and earth pass away, one iota or one point
shall by no means pass away from the law till all things are
accomplished. <sup class="v">5:19</sup>Whoever therefore shall
break one of the least of these commandments, and teach men so,
shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever shall
do and teach, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
<sup class="v">5:20</sup>For I tell you, that unless your
righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall
by no means enter into the kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">5:21</sup>You have heard that it
was said by the ancients, You shall not kill; and whoever kills
shall be subject to the judgment. <sup class="v">5:22</sup>But I
tell you, that every one who is angry with his brother shall be
subject to the judgment; and whoever says to his brother, Worthless
fellow, shall be subject to the Sanhedrim; and whoever says, You
fool, shall be subject to the hell of fire. <sup class=
"v">5:23</sup>If, therefore, you offer your gift on the altar, and
there remember that your brother has any thing against you,
<sup class="v">5:24</sup>leave there your gift before the altar,
and go and first be reconciled to your brother, and then come and
offer your gift. <sup class="v">5:25</sup>Agree with your accuser
quickly, while you are with him in the way, lest the accuser
deliver you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer,
and you be cast into prison. <sup class="v">5:26</sup>I tell you
truly, you shall not go out thence till you have paid the last
quadrans [4 mills].</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">5:27</sup>You have heard that it
was said, You shall not commit adultery; <sup class=
"v">5:28</sup>but I tell you, that every one who looks on a woman
to desire her inordinately, has already committed adultery with her
in his heart. <sup class="v">5:29</sup>But if your right eye
offends you, pluck it out and cast it from you; for it is better
for you that one of your members should perish, and not that your
whole body should be cast into hell. <sup class="v">5:30</sup>And
if your right hand offends you, cut it off and cast it from you;
for it is better for you that one of your members should perish,
and not that your whole body should go into hell. <sup class=
"v">5:31</sup>And it was said, Whoever would put away his wife, let
him give her a bill of divorcement. <sup class="v">5:32</sup>But I
tell you, that whoever puts away his wife, except for adultery,
causes her to commit adultery; and whoever marries her that is put
away, commits adultery. <sup class="v">5:33</sup>Again, you have
heard that it was said by the ancients, You shall not swear
falsely, but shall perform to the Lord your oaths. <sup class=
"v">5:34</sup>But I tell you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven,
for it is God's throne; <sup class="v">5:35</sup>nor by the earth,
for it is his footstool, nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of
the great King; <sup class="v">5:36</sup>nor swear by your head,
for you cannot make one hair white or black. <sup class=
"v">5:37</sup>But let your speech be, yes, yes, and no, no; for any
thing more than this is evil.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">5:38</sup>You have heard that it
was said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth. <sup class=
"v">5:39</sup>But I tell you not to resist the evil man; but
whoever shall strike you on the right cheek, turn to him the other
also; <sup class="v">5:40</sup>and if a man wishes to have a law
suit with you, and take away your coat, let him have your cloak
also; <sup class="v">5:41</sup>and whoever shall compel you to go
one mile, go two miles with him. <sup class="v">5:42</sup>Give to
him that asks, and from him that would borrow of you turn not away.
<sup class="v">5:43</sup>You have heard that it was said, You shall
love your neighbor, and hate your enemy. <sup class=
"v">5:44</sup>But I tell you, Love your enemies, and pray for those
that persecute you; <sup class="v">5:45</sup>that you may be
children of your Father in heaven; for he causes his sun to rise on
the evil and the good, and rains on the just and unjust.
<sup class="v">5:46</sup>For if you love those that love you, what
reward have you? Do not the publicans the same? <sup class=
"v">5:47</sup>And if you salute your brothers only, what do you do
more than [others]? Do not the gentiles also do the same?
<sup class="v">5:48</sup>Be therefore perfect, as your heavenly
Father is perfect.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">6:1</sup>But take heed not to
perform your righteousness before men, to be seen by them;
otherwise indeed, you have no reward from your Father in heaven.
<sup class="v">6:2</sup>When, therefore, you give in charity, sound
not a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do, in the synagogues
and in the streets, that they may be glorified by men. I tell you
truly, they have their reward. <sup class="v">6:3</sup>But when you
give in charity let not your left hand know what your right hand
does, <sup class="v">6:4</sup>that your charity may be in secret;
and your Father who sees in secret shall reward you.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">6:5</sup>And when you pray, be
not like the hypocrites; for they love to pray standing in the
synagogues, and at the corners of the streets, that they may be
seen by men. I tell you truly, they have their reward. <sup class=
"v">6:6</sup>But when you pray enter into your private room, and
having shut your door pray to your Father who is in secret; and
your Father who sees in secret shall reward you. <sup class=
"v">6:7</sup>And when you pray use not vain repetitions, as the
gentiles do; for they think they shall be heard for their much
speaking. <sup class="v">6:8</sup>Be not, therefore, like them; for
your Father knows what you need before you ask him. <sup class=
"v">6:9</sup>Pray, therefore, thus; Our Father in heaven, hallowed
be thy name; <sup class="v">6:10</sup>thy kingdom come; thy will be
done, as in heaven, so on earth; <sup class="v">6:11</sup>give us
to-day our essential bread, <sup class="v">6:12</sup>and forgive us
our debts as we forgive our debtors; <sup class="v">6:13</sup>and
bring us not into trial, but deliver us from evil. <sup class=
"v">6:14</sup>For if you forgive men their offenses, your heavenly
Father will forgive you; <sup class="v">6:15</sup>but if you
forgive not men, neither will your Father forgive your
offenses.</p>
<p class="pin">8 <sup class="v">6:16</sup>And when you fast, be
not like the hypocrites, of a sad countenance; for they disfigure
their faces that they may appear to men to fast. I tell you truly,
they have their reward. <sup class="v">6:17</sup>But when you fast,
anoint your head, and wash your face, <sup class="v">6:18</sup>that
you may not appear to men to fast, but to your Father in secret;
and your Father who sees in secret shall reward you.</p>
<p class="pin">9 <sup class="v">6:19</sup>Lay not up for
yourselves treasures on the earth, where a moth and corrosion
destroy, and where thieves dig through and steal. <sup class=
"v">6:20</sup>But lay up treasures for yourselves in heaven, where
neither a moth nor corrosion destroys, and where thieves dig not
through nor steal; <sup class="v">6:21</sup>for where your treasure
is, there will your heart be also.</p>
<p class="pin">10 <sup class="v">6:22</sup>The light of the body
is the eye. If, therefore, your eye is sound, your whole body will
be light; <sup class="v">6:23</sup>but if your eye is evil, your
whole body will be dark. If, therefore, the light which is in you
is darkness, how great is the darkness! <sup class="v">6:24</sup>No
one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the first, and
love the other, or he will adhere to the first, and despise the
other. You cannot serve God and riches. <sup class="v">6:25</sup>On
this account I tell you, be not anxious for your soul, what you
shall eat, or what you shall drink; nor for your body, what you
shall put on, is not the soul more than food, and the body more
than clothing? <sup class="v">6:26</sup>Look at the birds of
heaven; they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into
store-houses; but your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much
better than they? <sup class="v">6:27</sup>Which of you by being
anxious can add one cubit to his stature? <sup class=
"v">6:28</sup>And why are you anxious concerning clothing? Consider
the lilies of the field, how they grow; they perform no hard labor,
neither do they spin; <sup class="v">6:29</sup>but I tell you that
Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.
<sup class="v">6:30</sup>And if God so clothes the grass of the
field, which to-day is, and to-morrow is cast into the oven, will
he not much more clothe you, men of little faith? <sup class=
"v">6:31</sup>Be not anxious, therefore, saying, What shall we eat?
or what shall we drink? or with what shall we be clothed?
<sup class="v">6:32</sup>For after all these things the gentiles
seek; and your heavenly Father knows that you need all these
things. <sup class="v">6:33</sup>But seek first righteousness and
his kingdom, and all these things shall be added to you.
<sup class="v">6:34</sup>Be not anxious, therefore, for to-morrow,
for to-morrow will be anxious for its; sufficient for the day is
its evil.</p>
<p class="pin">11 <sup class="v">7:1</sup>Judge not, that you be
not judged; <sup class="v">7:2</sup>for with what judgment you
judge you shall be judged; and with what measure you measure it
shall be measured to you. <sup class="v">7:3</sup>And why do you
see a speck in your brother's eye, and not consider a beam in your
own eye? <sup class="v">7:4</sup>or how will you say to your
brother, Let me cast out the speck from your eye, and behold a beam
in your own eye? <sup class="v">7:5</sup>Hypocrite, cast out first
the beam from your eye, and then will you see clearly to cast out
the speck from your brother's eye. <sup class="v">7:6</sup>Give not
a holy thing to dogs, neither cast your pearls before swine, lest
they tread them down with their feet, and turn and rend you.
<sup class="v">7:7</sup>Ask, and it shall be given you. Seek, and
you shall find. Knock, and it shall be opened to you. <sup class=
"v">7:8</sup>For every one that asks, receives; and he that seeks,
finds; and to him that knocks, it shall be opened. <sup class=
"v">7:9</sup>Or is there any man of you, who, if his son asks bread
of him, will give him a stone? <sup class="v">7:10</sup>or if he
asks a fish, will give him a serpent? <sup class="v">7:11</sup>If
you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children,
how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to them
that ask him. <sup class="v">7:12</sup>All things, therefore, which
you wish men to do to you, do also thus to them; for this is the
law and the prophets.</p>
<p class="pin">12 <sup class="v">7:13</sup>Enter in through the
narrow gate, for wide is the gate; and spacious the way which leads
to destruction, and many are they that enter in by it; <sup class=
"v">7:14</sup>for narrow is the gate, and compressed the way which
leads to life, and few are those who find it. <sup class=
"v">7:15</sup>But beware of false prophets, who come to you in
sheep's clothing, but within they are rapacious wolves. <sup class=
"v">7:16</sup>You shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather
grapes from thorns? or figs from thistles? <sup class=
"v">7:17</sup>So every good tree bears good fruits, but a bad tree
bears bad fruits; <sup class="v">7:18</sup>a good tree cannot bear
bad fruits, nor a bad tree good fruits. <sup class=
"v">7:19</sup>Every tree which bears not good fruit is cut down and
cast into the fire. <sup class="v">7:20</sup>By their fruits,
therefore, you shall know them.</p>
<p class="pin">13 <sup class="v">7:21</sup>Not every one that
says to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but
he that does the will of my Father in heaven. <sup class=
"v">7:22</sup>Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we
not prophesied in your name, and in your name cast out demons, and
in your name performed many mighty works? <sup class=
"v">7:23</sup>and then will I confess to them, I never knew you;
depart from me you that commit wickedness.</p>
<p class="pin">14 <sup class="v">7:24</sup>Every one, therefore,
that hears these words of mine and performs them, I will liken to a
wise man who built his house on the rock; <sup class=
"v">7:25</sup>and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the
winds blew and beat on that house, and it fell not, for it was
founded on the rock. <sup class="v">7:26</sup>And every one who
hears these words of mine and performs them not, shall be likened
to a foolish man, who built his house on the sand; <sup class=
"v">7:27</sup>and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the
winds blew and beat on that house, and it fell; and its fall was
great. <sup class="v">7:28</sup>And when Jesus had finished these
words the multitudes were astonished at his teaching; <sup class=
"v">7:29</sup>for he taught them as having authority, and not as
their scribes.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST'S MIRACLES, PREVIOUS TO THE APPOINTMENT OF HIS TWELVE
APOSTLES.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">8:1</sup>AND when he went down
from the mountain great multitudes followed him; <sup class=
"v">8:2</sup>and behold, a leper came and worshipped him, saying,
Lord, if you will, you can cleanse me. <sup class="v">8:3</sup>And
stretching out his hand, he touched him, saying, I will; be
cleansed; and his leprosy was immediately cleansed. <sup class=
"v">8:4</sup>And Jesus said to him, See that you tell no man, but
go and show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift which Moses
commanded for a testimony to them.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">8:5</sup>And when he entered into
Capernaum a centurion came to him, beseeching him, <sup class=
"v">8:6</sup>and saying; Lord, my servant lies sick in my house
with paralysis, exceedingly distressed. <sup class="v">8:7</sup>He
said to him, I will come and cure him. <sup class="v">8:8</sup>And
the centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not fit that you should
come under my roof; but only say the word and my servant will be
cured. <sup class="v">8:9</sup>For I also am a man under authority,
having soldiers under me; and I say to this man, Go, and he goes;
and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and
he does it. <sup class="v">8:10</sup>Jesus hearing wondered and
said to those that followed him, I tell you truly, I have not found
so great a faith with any one in Israel; <sup class=
"v">8:11</sup>and I tell you that many shall come from the East and
from the West, and shall recline with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob
in the kingdom of heaven, <sup class="v">8:12</sup>but the children
of the kingdom shall be cast into the darkness outside; there shall
be weeping and gnashing of teeth. <sup class="v">8:13</sup>And
Jesus said to the centurion, Go; as you have believed be it to you;
and the servant was cured at that hour.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">8:14</sup>And Jesus coming into
the house of Peter, saw his wife's mother lying and sick with a
fever. <sup class="v">8:15</sup>And he touched her hand, and the
fever left her; and she arose and waited on them. <sup class=
"v">8:16</sup>And when it was evening they brought him many
demoniacs, and he cast out the spirits with a word, and cured all
that were sick, <sup class="v">8:17</sup>that the word might be
fulfilled spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying; He took our
infirmities and bore our diseases.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">8:18</sup>And Jesus seeing great
multitudes around him commanded them to go away to the other side.
<sup class="v">8:19</sup>And a certain scribe came and said to him,
Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go. <sup class=
"v">8:20</sup>And Jesus said to him, The foxes have holes, and the
birds of heaven have places of shelter, but the Son of man has not
where to lay his head. <sup class="v">8:21</sup>Another of the
disciples said to him, Lord, permit me first to go away and bury my
father. <sup class="v">8:22</sup>But Jesus said to him, Follow me,
and let the dead bury their dead. <sup class="v">8:23</sup>And he
entered into a ship, and his disciples followed him. <sup class=
"v">8:24</sup>And behold there was a great tempest on the lake, so
that the ship was covered with the waves; but he was asleep.
<sup class="v">8:25</sup>And they came and awoke him, saying, Lord,
save us; we perish. <sup class="v">8:26</sup>And he said to them,
Why are you afraid, men of little faith? Then he arose, and rebuked
the winds and the lake, and there was a great calm. <sup class=
"v">8:27</sup>And the men wondered, saying, What kind of a man is
this, that the winds and the lake obey him?</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">8:28</sup>And when he had come to
the other side, into the country of the Gadarenes, two demoniacs
met him, coming out of the tombs, exceedingly fierce, so that no
man could pass that way. <sup class="v">8:29</sup>And behold they
cried, saying, What have you to do with us, Son of God? Have you
come hither before the time to torment us? <sup class=
"v">8:30</sup>And there was far off from them a herd of many swine
feeding. <sup class="v">8:31</sup>And, the demons besought him,
saying, If you cast us out, send us into the herd of swine.
<sup class="v">8:32</sup>And he said to them, Go. And going out,
they went away into the herd of swine, and, behold, the whole herd
rushed down a precipice into the lake, and died in the waters;
<sup class="v">8:33</sup>and those who fed them fled, and going
away into the city reported all things, and the events relating to
the demoniacs. <sup class="v">8:34</sup>And behold all the city
came out to meet Jesus; and when they saw him they besought him to
depart from their bounds.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">9:1</sup>And entering a ship, he
crossed over, and came to his own city; <sup class="v">9:2</sup>and
behold they brought him a paralytic, lying on a bed. And Jesus
seeing their faith said to the paralytic, Son, be of good courage;
your sins are forgiven. <sup class="v">9:3</sup>And behold some of
the scribes said within themselves, This man blasphemes.
<sup class="v">9:4</sup>And Jesus observing their thoughts, said,
Why do you think evil in your hearts? <sup class="v">9:5</sup>For
in what respect is it easier to say, Your sins are forgiven, than
to say, Arise and walk? <sup class="v">9:6</sup>But that you may
know that the Son of man has power on the earth to forgive sins,
then he said to the paralytic, Arise, take up your bed, and go to
your house. <sup class="v">9:7</sup>And he arose and departed to
his house. <sup class="v">9:8</sup>And when the multitudes saw it
they were afraid, and glorified God who had given such power to
men.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">9:9</sup>And Jesus departing
thence saw a man sitting at the custom-house, called Matthew; and
he said to him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him.
<sup class="v">9:10</sup>And he was reclining in the house, and
behold, many publicans and sinners came and reclined with Jesus and
his disciples. <sup class="v">9:11</sup>And when the Pharisees saw
them they said to his disciples, Why does your teacher eat with
publicans and sinners? <sup class="v">9:12</sup>And hearing it he
said, The well need not a physician, but the sick. <sup class=
"v">9:13</sup>Go and learn what this means: I wish for mercy and
not a sacrifice; for I came not to call the righteous, but
sinners.</p>
<p class="pin">8 <sup class="v">9:14</sup>Then came to him the
disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast much,
but your disciples fast not? <sup class="v">9:15</sup>And Jesus
said to them, Can the children of the bridechamber mourn as long as
the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the
bridegroom will be taken from them, and then they shalt fast.
<sup class="v">9:16</sup>But no one puts a piece of unfilled cloth
on an old garment; for it takes away its fullness from the garment,
and the rent is made worse. <sup class="v">9:17</sup>Neither do
they put new wine into old bottles; otherwise the bottles break,
and the wine is poured out and the bottles destroyed; but they put
new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved.</p>
<p class="pin">9 <sup class="v">9:18</sup>While he was saying
these words to them, behold a ruler came and worshipped him,
saying, My daughter is now dead, but come and put your hand on her
and she shall live. <sup class="v">9:19</sup>And Jesus arose and
followed him, and his disciples. <sup class="v">9:20</sup>And
behold a woman having a hemorrhage of twelve years approached him
from behind, and touched the fringe of his garment; <sup class=
"v">9:21</sup>for she said within herself, If I can only touch his
garment I shall be cured. <sup class="v">9:22</sup>And Jesus
turning around and seeing her, said, Daughter, be of good courage,
your faith has cured you. And the woman was cured from that
hour.</p>
<p class="pin">10 <sup class="v">9:23</sup>And Jesus coming into
the house of the ruler, and seeing the musicians and the multitude
making a tumultuous noise, <sup class="v">9:24</sup>said, Go away;
for the girl is not dead, but asleep. And they derided him.
<sup class="v">9:25</sup>But when the multitude were removed he
went in and took her hand, and the girl arose. <sup class=
"v">9:26</sup>And the report went out into all that land.</p>
<p class="pin">11 <sup class="v">9:27</sup>And as Jesus was
departing thence two blind men followed him, crying and saying,
Have mercy on us, Son of David! <sup class="v">9:28</sup>And when
he had gone into the house the blind men came to him, and Jesus
said to them, Do you believe that I am able to do this? They said
to him, Yes, Lord. <sup class="v">9:29</sup>Then he touched their
eyes, saying, According to your faith be it to you; <sup class=
"v">9:30</sup>and their eyes were opened. And Jesus charged them
strictly, saying, See that no one knows it. <sup class=
"v">9:31</sup>But they went out and made him known in all that
land.</p>
<p class="pin">12 <sup class="v">9:32</sup>And when they had gone
away, behold, the people brought to him a man, a dumb demoniac.
<sup class="v">9:33</sup>And the demon being cast out, the dumb
spoke; and the multitudes wondered, saying, It was never so seen in
Israel. <sup class="v">9:34</sup>But the Pharisees said, He casts
out demons by the ruler of the demons.</p>
<p class="pin">13 <sup class="v">9:35</sup>And Jesus went about
all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and
preaching the good news of the kingdom, and curing every disease,
and every infirmity. <sup class="v">9:36</sup>And seeing the
multitudes he had compassion on them because they were faint and
scattered, like sheep without a shepherd. <sup class=
"v">9:37</sup>Then he said to his disciples, The harvest indeed is
great, but the laborers few. <sup class="v">9:38</sup>Pray,
therefore, the Lord of the harvest to thrust laborers into his
harvest.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<h3>THE APPOINTMENT OF THE TWELVE APOSTLES.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">10:1</sup>AND calling his twelve
disciples, he gave them power over impure spirits to cast them out,
and to cure every disease and every infirmity. <sup class=
"v">10:2</sup>And the names of the twelve apostles are these;
First, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James,
the son of Zebedee, and John his brother; <sup class=
"v">10:3</sup>Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the
publican; James, the son of Alpheus, and Lebbeus, called Thaddeus;
<sup class="v">10:4</sup>Simon, the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, who
also betrayed him. <sup class="v">10:5</sup>These twelve Jesus sent
out and charged them, saying; Go not into a way of gentiles, and
enter not into a city of Samaritans, <sup class="v">10:6</sup>but
go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel; <sup class=
"v">10:7</sup>and as you go, preach, saying, The kingdom of Heaven
is at hand. <sup class="v">10:8</sup>Cure the sick, cleanse lepers,
cast out demons; you have received gratuitously, gratuitously give.
<sup class="v">10:9</sup>Take not gold, nor silver, nor copper for
your purses, <sup class="v">10:10</sup>nor a provision sack for the
way, nor two coats, nor shoes, nor staves; for the laborer is
worthy of his support; <sup class="v">10:11</sup>and into whatever
city or village you enter, inquire who in it is worthy, and there
remain till you leave. <sup class="v">10:12</sup>And when you go
into a house, salute it; <sup class="v">10:13</sup>and if the house
is worthy, your blessing shall come upon it; but if the house is
not worthy, your blessing shall return to you. <sup class=
"v">10:14</sup>And if any one does not receive you, nor hear your
words, when you go out of that house or that city, shake off the
dust of your feet. <sup class="v">10:15</sup>I tell you truly, it
shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in a day
of judgment, than for that city.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">10:16</sup>Behold, I send you
forth as sheep in the midst of wolves; be therefore wise as
serpents and harmless as doves. <sup class="v">10:17</sup>But
beware of men; for they will deliver you to Sanhedrims, and scourge
you in their synagogues, <sup class="v">10:18</sup>and you shall be
brought before governors, and kings, for my sake, for a testimony
to them and the nations. <sup class="v">10:19</sup>But when they
have delivered you up be not anxious how you shall speak, or what
you shall say, for it shall be given you in that hour what to say;
<sup class="v">10:20</sup>for it is not you that speak, but the
Spirit of your Father that speaks in you. <sup class=
"v">10:21</sup>And a brother shall deliver a brother to death, and
a father a son; and children shall rise up against their parents
and put them to death; <sup class="v">10:22</sup>and you shall be
hated by all men for my sake. But he that endures to the end shall
be saved. <sup class="v">10:23</sup>And when they persecute you in
one city, flee to another. For I tell you truly, that you will not
finish the cities of Israel till the Son of man shall come.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">10:24</sup>A disciple is not
above his teacher, nor a servant above his master. <sup class=
"v">10:25</sup>It is sufficient for the disciple to be as his
teacher, and the servant as his master. If they have called the
master of the house Beelzebul, how much more will they call the
members of his family by that name. <sup class="v">10:26</sup>Fear
them not, therefore, for there is nothing concealed that shall not
be revealed, nor hid that shall not be known. <sup class=
"v">10:27</sup>What I tell you in darkness, speak in the light, and
what you hear in the ear, preach on the house-tops. <sup class=
"v">10:28</sup>And fear not those who kill the body and are not
able to kill the soul; but rather fear him who is able to destroy
both soul and body in hell.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">10:29</sup>Are not two sparrows
sold for an assarion [1.5 mills]? and one of them cannot fall to
the ground without your Father. <sup class="v">10:30</sup>Even the
hairs of your head are all numbered. <sup class="v">10:31</sup>Fear
not, therefore, you are of more value than many sparrows.
<sup class="v">10:32</sup>Every one, therefore, who shall confess
me before men, him will I also confess before my Father in heaven;
<sup class="v">10:33</sup>and whoever denies me before men, him
will I also deny before my Father in heaven.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">10:34</sup>Think not that I have
come to send peace on the earth. I have not come to send peace, but
a sword. <sup class="v">10:35</sup>I have come to set a man at
variance against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and
a bride against her mother-in-law; <sup class="v">10:36</sup>and a
man's enemies shall be those of his own house. <sup class=
"v">10:37</sup>He that loves father or mother more than me is not
worthy of me; and he that loves son or daughter more than me is not
worthy of me; <sup class="v">10:38</sup>and he that does not take
up his cross and follow me is not worthy of me. <sup class=
"v">10:39</sup>He that finds his life shall lose it, and he that
loses his life for my sake shall find it. <sup class=
"v">10:40</sup>He that receives you receives me, and he that
receives me receives him that sent me. <sup class="v">10:41</sup>He
that receives a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a
prophet's reward, and he that receives a righteous man in the name
of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward.
<sup class="v">10:42</sup>And whoever shall give one of these
little ones a cup of cold water only, in the name of a disciple, I
tell you truly, he shall by no means lose his reward. <sup class=
"v">11:1</sup>And when Jesus had finished his charge to his twelve
disciples, he departed thence to teach and preach in their
cities.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<h3>JOHN THE BAPTIST QUESTIONING CHRIST'S MESSIAHSHIP.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">11:2</sup>AND John hearing in the
prison of the works of Christ, sending by his disciples,
<sup class="v">11:3</sup>said to him, Are you he that was coming,
or look we for another? <sup class="v">11:4</sup>And Jesus answered
and said to them, Go and tell John what you see and hear;
<sup class="v">11:5</sup>the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers
are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the poor have
the good news preached to them; <sup class="v">11:6</sup>and
blessed is he that is not offended with me.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">11:7</sup>And when they had gone,
Jesus began to say to the multitudes, concerning John, What went
you out to the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind?
<sup class="v">11:8</sup>But what went you out to see? A man
wearing fine clothes? Behold, they that wear fine clothes are in
the houses of kings. <sup class="v">11:9</sup>But what went you out
to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.
<sup class="v">11:10</sup>For this is he of whom it is written;
Behold, I send my messenger before your face, to prepare your way
before you. <sup class="v">11:11</sup>I tell you truly, there has
not arisen among those born of woman a greater than John the
Baptist; but the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
<sup class="v">11:12</sup>And from the days of John the Baptist
till now the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and the violent
take it by force. <sup class="v">11:13</sup>For all the prophets
and the law prophesied till John. <sup class="v">11:14</sup>And if
you will receive it, this is Elijah, who was to come.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">11:15</sup>He that has ears, let
him hear. <sup class="v">11:16</sup>To what shall I liken this
generation? It is like little children sitting in the markets, who
call to their companions, <sup class="v">11:17</sup>and say, We
have played on pipes for you, and you have not danced; we have
mourned, and you have not lamented. <sup class="v">11:18</sup>For
John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He has a
demon; <sup class="v">11:19</sup>the Son of man came eating and
drinking, and they say, Behold a glutton, and a wine drinker, a
friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom is justified by her
children.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">11:20</sup>Then he began to
rebuke those cities in which most of his mighty works had been
done, because they changed not their minds. <sup class=
"v">11:21</sup>Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! for if
the mighty works which have been done in you had been done in Tyre
and Sidon, they would have changed their minds long ago in
sackcloth and ashes. <sup class="v">11:22</sup>But I tell you, it
shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in a day of judgment
than for you. <sup class="v">11:23</sup>And you, Capernaum, which
are exalted even to heaven, shall go down even to hades; for if the
mighty works which have been done in you had been done in Sodom, it
would have remained to this day. <sup class="v">11:24</sup>But I
tell you, that it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in
a day of judgment, than for you.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">11:25</sup>At that time Jesus
answering said, I thank thee, Father, Lord of heaven and earth,
that thou hast hid these things from the wise and intelligent, and
hast revealed them to babes. <sup class="v">11:26</sup>Yes, Father,
for so it has seemed good in thy sight. <sup class=
"v">11:27</sup>All things are given me by my Father; and no one
knows the Son but the Father; and no one knows the Father but the
Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him. <sup class=
"v">11:28</sup>Come to me all you that labor hard and are heavy
laden, and I will give you rest. <sup class="v">11:29</sup>Take my
yoke upon you, and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart,
and you shall find rest for your souls; <sup class=
"v">11:30</sup>for my yoke is easy, and my burden light.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST'S DOCTRINE OF THE SABBATH.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">12:1</sup>AT that time Jesus went
through the grain fields on the sabbath; and his disciples were
hungry, and began to pick the heads and eat. <sup class=
"v">12:2</sup>And the Pharisees seeing it, said to him, Behold,
your disciples do what it is not lawful to do on the sabbath.
<sup class="v">12:3</sup>But he said to them, Have you not read
what David did, when he was hungry, and those who were with him?
<sup class="v">12:4</sup>how he entered into the house of God and
eat the show bread, which it was not lawful for him to eat, nor for
those with him, but only for the priests? <sup class=
"v">12:5</sup>Or have you not read in the law, that the priests
profane the sabbath in the temple, and are blameless? <sup class=
"v">12:6</sup>But I tell you that here is an object greater than
the temple. <sup class="v">12:7</sup>But if you had known what, I
wish for mercy and not a sacrifice, means, you would not have
condemned the innocent; <sup class="v">12:8</sup>for the Son of man
is Lord of the Sabbath.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">12:9</sup>And departing thence he
went into their synagogue, <sup class="v">12:10</sup>and behold a
man having a withered hand [was there]. And they asked him, saying,
Is it lawful to cure on the sabbath? that they might accuse him.
<sup class="v">12:11</sup>And he said to them, What man is there of
you having one sheep, who if this falls into a pit on the sabbath,
will not take hold of it and lift it out? <sup class=
"v">12:12</sup>How much then is a man better than a sheep! So that
it is lawful to do good on the sabbath. <sup class=
"v">12:13</sup>Then he said to the man, Stretch out your hand; and
he stretched it out, and it was restored as sound as the other;
<sup class="v">12:14</sup>and the Pharisees went out and took
counsel against him to destroy him.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">12:15</sup>But Jesus knowing it
departed thence, and great multitudes followed him; and he cured
them all, <sup class="v">12:16</sup>and charged them not to make
him known; <sup class="v">12:17</sup>that it might be fulfilled
which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying; <sup class=
"v">12:18</sup>Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved,
with whom my soul is well pleased; I will put my spirit on him, and
he shall declare judgment to the nations. <sup class=
"v">12:19</sup>He shall not strive nor cry aloud, nor shall any one
hear his voice in the streets. <sup class="v">12:20</sup>A bruised
reed shall he not break, and a smoking flax shall he not
extinguish, till he sends forth judgment to victory. <sup class=
"v">12:21</sup>And in his name shall nations hope.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST'S MIRACLES ATTRIBUTED TO DEMONS. HIS RELATIONS.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">12:22</sup>THEN a blind and dumb
demoniac was brought to him, and he cured him, so that the blind
and dumb spoke and saw. <sup class="v">12:23</sup>And all the
multitudes wondered and said, Is this the Son of David? <sup class=
"v">12:24</sup>But the Pharisees hearing it, said, This man does
not cast out demons, except by Beelzebul, a ruler of the demons.
<sup class="v">12:25</sup>But knowing their thoughts, he said to
them, Every kingdom divided against itself is destroyed; and no
city or house divided against itself can stand. <sup class=
"v">12:26</sup>If Satan casts out Satan he is divided against
himself. How then can his kingdom stand? <sup class=
"v">12:27</sup>And if I by Beelzebul cast out demons, by whom do
your sons cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges.
<sup class="v">12:28</sup>But if I by the Spirit of God cast out
demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you. <sup class=
"v">12:29</sup>Or how can one enter into the house of a strong man
and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man, and
then he will plunder his house.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">12:30</sup>He that is not with me
is against me, and he that gathers not with me scatters.
<sup class="v">12:31</sup>Therefore, I tell you, every sin and
blasphemy shall be forgiven men, but the blasphemy of the Spirit
shall not be forgiven men. <sup class="v">12:32</sup>And if one
speaks a word against the Son of man it shall be forgiven him; but
if one speaks against the Holy Spirit it shall not be forgiven him
either in this life or in that to come. <sup class=
"v">12:33</sup>Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or
make the tree bad, and its fruit bad; for a tree is known by its
fruit. <sup class="v">12:34</sup>Offspring of vipers, how can you,
being evil, speak good things? For out of the abundance of the
heart the mouth speaks. <sup class="v">12:35</sup>The good man, out
of his good treasury, casts forth good things; and the evil man,
out of his evil treasury, casts forth evil things. <sup class=
"v">12:36</sup>But I tell you, that for every idle word which men
speak they shall render an account in a day of judgment;
<sup class="v">12:37</sup>for by your words you shall be justified,
and by your words you shall be condemned.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">12:38</sup>Then answered some of
the scribes and Pharisees, saying, Teacher, we wish to see a sign
from you. <sup class="v">12:39</sup>But he answered and said to
them, An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, and no
sign shall be given it but the sign of the prophet Jonah.
<sup class="v">12:40</sup>For as Jonah was three days and three
nights in the belly of the fish, so shall the Son of man be three
days and three nights in the heart of the earth. <sup class=
"v">12:41</sup>The men of Nineveh shall rise up in the judgment
with this generation and condemn it; for they changed their minds
at the preaching of Jonah; and behold a greater than Jonah is here.
<sup class="v">12:42</sup>The queen of the south shall rise up in
the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for she came from
the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold a
greater than Solomon is here. <sup class="v">12:43</sup>But when
the impure spirit has gone out of a man, it goes through dry places
seeking a rest, and finds none. <sup class="v">12:44</sup>Then it
says, I will return to my house from which I went out; and coming,
it finds it empty, swept, and adorned. <sup class=
"v">12:45</sup>Then it goes and takes with itself seven other
spirits worse than itself, and they enter in and dwell there; and
the last state of that man is worse than the first. So shall it be
also with this evil generation.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">12:46</sup>And while he was
speaking to the multitudes, behold his mother and his brothers
stood without, desiring to speak to him. <sup class=
"v">12:47</sup>And some one said to him, Behold your mother and
your brothers stand without, desiring to speak to you. <sup class=
"v">12:48</sup>And he answered and said to him that told him, Who
is my mother? and who are my brothers? <sup class=
"v">12:49</sup>and stretching out his hand to his disciples, he
said, Behold my mother, and my brothers! <sup class=
"v">12:50</sup>For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven, he
is my brother, and sister, and mother.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST'S PARABLES ON THE LAKE OF GALILEE.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">13:1</sup>AND on that day Jesus
went out of the house and sat by the lake. <sup class=
"v">13:2</sup>And great multitudes came together to him; and he
went into the ship and sat down; and all the multitude stood on the
shore. <sup class="v">13:3</sup>And he spoke to them many things in
parables, saying; Behold, a sower went out to sow; <sup class=
"v">13:4</sup>and as he sowed, some fell by the way, and the birds
came and devoured it. <sup class="v">13:5</sup>And some fell on
rocky places, where it had not much earth, and it came up
immediately, because it had no depth of earth; <sup class=
"v">13:6</sup>and when the sun arose it was scorched, and because
it had no root it was dried up. <sup class="v">13:7</sup>And some
fell among thorns, and the thorns came up and choked it.
<sup class="v">13:8</sup>But some fell on good ground, and bore
fruit; some a hundred, some sixty, and some thirty-fold.
<sup class="v">13:9</sup>He that has ears let him hear.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">13:10</sup>And his disciples came
and said to him, Why do you speak to them in parables? <sup class=
"v">13:11</sup>And he answered and said to them, Because it is
given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to
them it is not given; <sup class="v">13:12</sup>for whoever has, to
him shall be also given, and he shall abound; but whoever has not,
from him shall be taken away even what he has. <sup class=
"v">13:13</sup>For this reason I speak to them in parables; because
seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor
understand. <sup class="v">13:14</sup>And in them is fulfilled the
prophecy of Isaiah, which says; Hearing you shall hear and not
understand, and seeing you shall see and not perceive; <sup class=
"v">13:15</sup>for the hearts of this people have become hard, and
they hear imperfectly with their ears, and their eyes have they
closed, lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their
ears, and understand with their hearts, and turn, and I should heal
them. <sup class="v">13:16</sup>But blessed are your eyes, for they
see; and your ears, for they hear. <sup class="v">13:17</sup>For I
tell you truly, that many prophets and righteous men have desired
to see what you see and have not seen it, and to hear what you hear
and have not heard it.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">13:18</sup>Hear, therefore, the
parable of the sower. <sup class="v">13:19</sup>When any one hears
the word of the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one
comes and takes away the seed sown in his heart. This is he that
received seed by the way. <sup class="v">13:20</sup>He that
received seed on the rocky places is he that hears the word and
immediately receives it with joy <sup class="v">13:21</sup>but has
no root in himself, but is only a temporary [disciple]; and when
affliction or persecution arises on account of the word, he is
immediately offended. <sup class="v">13:22</sup>And he that
received seed among thorns is he that hears the word, and the cares
of this life and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and it
becomes unfruitful. <sup class="v">13:23</sup>But he that received
the seed in the good ground is he that hears the word, and
understands it, who also bears fruit, and produces some one
hundred, and some sixty, and some thirty-fold.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">13:24</sup>And he delivered them
another parable, saying; The kingdom of heaven is like a man sowing
good seed in his field; <sup class="v">13:25</sup>and while the men
slept, his enemy came and sowed poisonous darnel in the midst of
the wheat, and went away. <sup class="v">13:26</sup>But when the
stalk grew up and bore fruit, then the poisonous darnel appeared.
<sup class="v">13:27</sup>And the servants of the householder came
and said to him, Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field?
Whence then has it poisonous darnel? <sup class="v">13:28</sup>And
he said to them, An enemy has done this. And they said to him, Do
you wish us to go and take them out? <sup class="v">13:29</sup>And
he said, No; lest in taking out the poisonous darnel, you pull up
the wheat with it; <sup class="v">13:30</sup>let both grow together
till the harvest, and at the time of the harvest, I will say to the
reapers, Collect first the poisonous darnel, and bind it in bundles
to be burnt; but collect the wheat in my storehouse.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">13:31</sup>He delivered them
another parable, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard
seed which a man took and sowed in his field, <sup class=
"v">13:32</sup>which is the least of all seeds, but when it is
grown is the greatest of plants, and becomes a tree, so that the
birds of heaven come and lodge on its branches. <sup class=
"v">13:33</sup>He spoke another parable to them; The kingdom of
heaven is like leaven which a woman took and hid in three sata [33
quarts] of flour, till the whole was leavened. <sup class=
"v">13:34</sup>All these things spoke Jesus to the multitudes in
parables; and without a parable spoke he not to them; <sup class=
"v">13:35</sup>that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the
prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will declare
things which have been concealed from the foundation of the
world.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">13:36</sup>Then leaving the
multitudes; he went into the house, and his disciples came to him,
saying, Explain to us the parable of the poisonous darnel of the
field. <sup class="v">13:37</sup>And he answered and said to them,
He that sows the good seed is the Son of man; <sup class=
"v">13:38</sup>the field is the world; the good seed are the
children of the kingdom; the poisonous darnel are the children of
the wicked one; <sup class="v">13:39</sup>the enemy that sowed them
is the devil; the harvest is the consummation of the world; and the
reapers are angels. <sup class="v">13:40</sup>As, therefore,
poisonous darnel is collected and burned with fire, so shall it be
at the consummation of the world. <sup class="v">13:41</sup>The Son
of man will send his angels, and they shall collect out of his
kingdom all offenses, and all that commit wickedness, <sup class=
"v">13:42</sup>and cast them into a furnace of fire; and there
shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. <sup class=
"v">13:43</sup>Then the righteous shall shine out like the sun, in
the kingdom of their Father. He that has ears, let him hear.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">13:44</sup>The kingdom of heaven
is like a treasure hid in a field, which a man found, and
concealed, and went away with joy, and sold all that he had and
bought that field. <sup class="v">13:45</sup>Again; the kingdom of
heaven is like a merchant seeking beautiful pearls, <sup class=
"v">13:46</sup>who, finding one very costly, went and sold all that
he had and bought it. <sup class="v">13:47</sup>Again; the kingdom
of heaven is like a net cast into the sea, and collecting [fish] of
every kind, <sup class="v">13:48</sup>which, when it was full, men
drew to the shore, and sifting down put up the good in vessels and
cast the bad away. <sup class="v">13:49</sup>So shall it be at the
consummation of the world. The angels shall come forth and separate
the evil from the midst of the good, <sup class="v">13:50</sup>and
cast them into the furnace of fire; there shall be weeping and
gnashing of teeth. <sup class="v">13:51</sup>Have you understood
all these thing? They said to him, Yes, Lord. <sup class=
"v">13:52</sup>And he said to them, Every scribe therefore that is
instructed in the kingdom of heaven, is like a householder who
casts out of his treasury things new and old.</p>
<p class="pin">8 <sup class="v">13:53</sup>And when Jesus had
finished these parables he departed thence, <sup class=
"v">13:54</sup>and coming to his native country he taught them in
their synagogues, so that they were astonished and said, Whence has
this man this wisdom and these mighty works? <sup class=
"v">13:55</sup>Is not this the carpenter's son? Is not his mother
called Mary? And are not his brothers James, and Joseph, and Simon,
and Judas? <sup class="v">13:56</sup>And are not his sisters all
with us? Whence then has this man all these things? <sup class=
"v">13:57</sup>And they were offended with him. But Jesus said to
them, A prophet is not without honor, except in his native country,
and in his own house; <sup class="v">13:58</sup>and he did not many
mighty works there, because of their unbelief.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>
<h3>THE DEATH OF JOHN THE BAPTIST.&mdash;CHRIST FEEDING FIVE
THOUSAND, AND WALKING ON THE LAKE.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">14:1</sup>AT that time Herod the
Tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus, <sup class="v">14:2</sup>and
said to his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is raised from
the dead; and on that account the mighty works are performed by
him. <sup class="v">14:3</sup>For Herod having seized John, had
bound him, and put him in prison, on account of Herodias, his
brother Philip's wife. <sup class="v">14:4</sup>For John had said
to him, It is not lawful for you to have her. <sup class=
"v">14:5</sup>And he wished to kill him; but feared the people,
because they regarded him as a prophet. <sup class=
"v">14:6</sup>And Herod's birthday being kept, the daughter of
Herodias danced before them and pleased Herod, <sup class=
"v">14:7</sup>on account of which he promised with an oath to give
her whatever she should ask; <sup class="v">14:8</sup>and she,
having been put forward by her mother, said, Give me here on a
plate the head of John the Baptist.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">14:9</sup>And the king was sorry;
but on account of the oath, and those reclining with him, he
commanded it to be given. <sup class="v">14:10</sup>And he sent and
beheaded John in the prison; <sup class="v">14:11</sup>and his head
was brought on a plate and given to the girl, and she carried it to
her mother. <sup class="v">14:12</sup>And his disciples went and
took up the body and buried it, and came and told Jesus.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">14:13</sup>And when Jesus heard
of it he departed thence in a ship to a solitary place by himself.
And the multitudes hearing of it followed him on foot from the
cities.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">14:14</sup>And going out he saw a
great multitude, and had compassion on them, and cured their sick.
<sup class="v">14:15</sup>And when it was evening his disciples
came to him, saying, The place is solitary, and the hour is already
past; dismiss the multitudes that they may go to the villages and
buy themselves food. <sup class="v">14:16</sup>But Jesus said to
them, They need not go away; give them food to eat. <sup class=
"v">14:17</sup>And they said to him, We have here only five loaves
and two fishes. <sup class="v">14:18</sup>And he said, Bring them
here to me. <sup class="v">14:19</sup>And commanding the multitudes
to sit down on the grass, he took the five loaves and the two
fishes, and, looking up to heaven, blessed them, and having broken
them gave the bread to the disciples, and the disciples to the
multitudes. <sup class="v">14:20</sup>And they all eat and were
filled; and they took up the fragments which remained over, twelve
travelling-baskets full; <sup class="v">14:21</sup>and those that
eat were about five thousand men, besides women and children.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">14:22</sup>And he immediately
constrained the disciples to go into a ship and go before him to
the other side, till he should dismiss the multitudes. <sup class=
"v">14:23</sup>And having dismissed the multitudes, he went on a
mountain by himself to pray. And when it was evening he was there
alone. <sup class="v">14:24</sup>But the ship was now in the midst
of the lake tossed by the waves, for the wind was contrary.
<sup class="v">14:25</sup>And in the fourth watch of the night he
came to them walking on the lake. <sup class="v">14:26</sup>And
when the disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were troubled
and said, It is an apparition; and they cried out for fear.
<sup class="v">14:27</sup>But Jesus immediately spoke to them,
saying, Be of good courage; it is I; be not afraid. <sup class=
"v">14:28</sup>And Peter answered and said to him, Lord, if it is
you, command me to come to you on the waters. <sup class=
"v">14:29</sup>And he said, Come. And Peter going down from the
ship walked on the waters to go to Jesus. <sup class=
"v">14:30</sup>But seeing the wind strong he was afraid; and
beginning to sink, cried, saying, Lord save me! <sup class=
"v">14:31</sup>and Jesus immediately stretching out his hand, took
hold of him and said, Man of little faith, why did you doubt?
<sup class="v">14:32</sup>And when they entered into the ship, the
wind ceased; <sup class="v">14:33</sup>and those in the ship came
and worshipped him; saying, Truly you are the Son of God.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">14:34</sup>And having crossed
over, they came to Gennesaret. <sup class="v">14:35</sup>And when
the men of that place knew him, they sent to all the country
around, and brought to him all that were sick, <sup class=
"v">14:36</sup>and requested of him that they might only touch the
fringe of his garment; and as many as touched it were entirely
cured.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST'S DOCTRINE OF JEWISH TRADITIONS, ETC.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">15:1</sup>THEN came the scribes
and Pharisees from Jerusalem, saying, <sup class="v">15:2</sup>Why
do your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders, for they
wash not their hands when they eat bread? <sup class=
"v">15:3</sup>And he answered and said to them, Why do you
transgress the command of God by your tradition? <sup class=
"v">15:4</sup>For God said, Honor your father and mother; and he
that reviles father or mother, let him surely die. <sup class=
"v">15:5</sup>But you say, Whoever says to his father or mother
what you might be profited with by me is a gift, <sup class=
"v">15:6</sup>then he shall not honor his father or his mother; and
you have made the law of God of no effect by your tradition.
<sup class="v">15:7</sup>Hypocrites, well did Isaiah prophecy of
you, saying; <sup class="v">15:8</sup>This people honors me with
the lips, but their heart is far from me. <sup class=
"v">15:9</sup>But in vain do they worship me, teaching teachings
and commandments of men.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">15:10</sup>And having called the
multitude, he said, Hear and understand. <sup class=
"v">15:11</sup>Not that which enters into the mouth, defiles the
man; but that which proceeds out of the mouth that defiles the man.
<sup class="v">15:12</sup>Then the disciples came to him, and said
to him, Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they
heard this word? <sup class="v">15:13</sup>And he answered and
said, Every plant which my heavenly Father has not planted, shall
be rooted up. <sup class="v">15:14</sup>Let them go; they are blind
guides of the blind. But if the blind lead the blind, they will
both fall into the pit. <sup class="v">15:15</sup>And Peter
answered and said to him, Explain the parable to us. <sup class=
"v">15:16</sup>And he said, Are you so entirely without
understanding? <sup class="v">15:17</sup>Do you not understand that
whatever goes into the mouth passes into the stomach, and is cast
out on the earth? <sup class="v">15:18</sup>But the things which
proceed from the mouth come from the heart, and these defile the
man. <sup class="v">15:19</sup>For from the heart proceed evil
thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false
testimonies, blasphemies: <sup class="v">15:20</sup>these are the
things which defile the man; but to eat with unwashed hands does
not defile the man.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">15:21</sup>And Jesus going out
thence departed to the regions of Tyre and Sidon. <sup class=
"v">15:22</sup>And behold, a woman of Canaan from those regions
came out and cried, saying, Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David;
my daughter is badly affected with a demon. <sup class=
"v">15:23</sup>But he answered her not a word. And his disciples
came and asked him, saying, Dismiss her, for she cries after us.
<sup class="v">15:24</sup>But he answered and said, I am not sent,
except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. <sup class=
"v">15:25</sup>And she came and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help
me! <sup class="v">15:26</sup>But he answered and said, It is not
right to take the children's bread and cast to the dogs.
<sup class="v">15:27</sup>But she said, Yes, Lord; for even the
dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from the table of their masters.
<sup class="v">15:28</sup>Then Jesus answered and said to her, O
woman, great is your faith! Be it to you as you wish; and her
daughter was cured from that hour.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">15:29</sup>And returning thence
Jesus came to the lake of Galilee, and going up on the mountain sat
down there. <sup class="v">15:30</sup>And great multitudes came to
him, having with them the lame, the blind, the dumb, the crippled,
and many others; and they cast them at Jesus' feet, and he cured
them; <sup class="v">15:31</sup>so that the multitude wondered,
seeing the dumb talk, the crippled sound, the lame walk, and the
blind see; and they glorified the God of Israel.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">15:32</sup>And Jesus calling his
disciples, said, I pity the multitude, for it is now three days
that they have continued with me, and they have nothing to eat; I
will not dismiss them fasting lest they faint by the way.
<sup class="v">15:33</sup>But his disciples said to him, Whence
shall we obtain so much bread in the wilderness as to fill so great
a multitude? <sup class="v">15:34</sup>And Jesus said to them, How
many loaves have you? And they said, Seven, and a few small fishes.
<sup class="v">15:35</sup>And he commanded the people to sit down
on the ground, <sup class="v">15:36</sup>and taking the seven
loaves and the fishes, and giving thanks, he broke, and gave them
to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes. <sup class=
"v">15:37</sup>And they all eat and were filled; and they took up
the fragments that remained, seven store-baskets full. <sup class=
"v">15:38</sup>And those who eat were four thousand men, besides
women and children. <sup class="v">15:39</sup>And dismissing the
multitude he went into the ship, and came into the bounds of
Magadan.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST REPLYING TO THE PHARISEES AND SADDUCEES, ETC.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">16:1</sup>AND the Pharisees and
Sadducees coming to Jesus to try him desired him to show them a
sign from heaven. <sup class="v">16:2</sup>But he answered and said
to them, When it is evening you say, It will be fair weather for
the sky is red; <sup class="v">16:3</sup>and in the morning, It
will rain to-day for the sky is red and lowering. You know how to
distinguish the face of the sky, but you cannot distinguish the
signs of the times. <sup class="v">16:4</sup>An evil and adulterous
generation seeks a sign; and no sign shall be given it except the
sign of Jonah. And he left them and departed.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">16:5</sup>And when his disciples
came to the other side they forgot to take bread. <sup class=
"v">16:6</sup>And Jesus said to them, Observe and beware of the
leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees. <sup class="v">16:7</sup>But
they reasoned within themselves, saying, It is because we have not
taken bread. <sup class="v">16:8</sup>But Jesus knowing it, said,
Why do you reason within yourselves, men of little faith, because
you have not taken bread? <sup class="v">16:9</sup>Do you not yet
understand nor remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and
how many travelling-baskets you took up? <sup class=
"v">16:10</sup>nor the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how
many store-baskets you took up? <sup class="v">16:11</sup>Why do
you not understand that I spoke to you not of bread, to beware of
the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees? <sup class=
"v">16:12</sup>Then they understood that he did not tell them to
beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees
and Sadducees.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">16:13</sup>And Jesus coming into
the parts of Cesarea Philippi, asked his disciples, saying, Who do
men say that the Son of man is? <sup class="v">16:14</sup>And they
said, Some, John the Baptist; others, Elijah; and others, Jeremiah,
or one of the prophets. <sup class="v">16:15</sup>And he said to
them, Who say you that I am? <sup class="v">16:16</sup>And Simon
Peter answered and said, You are the Christ, the Son of the living
God. <sup class="v">16:17</sup>And Jesus answered and said to him,
Blessed are you, Simon, son of Jonas, for flesh and blood has not
revealed this to you, but my Father in heaven. <sup class=
"v">16:18</sup>And I tell you that you are Peter [a rock], and upon
this rock will I build my assembly, and the gates of hades shall
not prevail against it. <sup class="v">16:19</sup>And I will give
you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatever you bind on the
earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatever you unbind on the
earth shall be unbound in heaven. <sup class="v">16:20</sup>Then he
charged his disciples to tell no man that he was the Christ.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">16:21</sup>From that time Jesus
began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem, and
suffer many things from the elders, and chief priests, and scribes,
and be killed, and raised on the third day. <sup class=
"v">16:22</sup>And Peter taking hold of him said, rebuking him, Far
be it from you, Lord! This shall not be to you. <sup class=
"v">16:23</sup>But he turned and said to Peter, Get behind me,
Satan! You are an offense to me! For you regard not the things of
God, but those of men.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">16:24</sup>Then Jesus said to his
disciples, If any one will come after me, let him deny himself, and
take up his cross, and follow me. <sup class="v">16:25</sup>For
whoever wishes to save his life shall lose it, and whoever loses
his life for my sake, shall find it. <sup class="v">16:26</sup>For
what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world and lose
his life? Or what will a man give as an exchange for his life?
<sup class="v">16:27</sup>For the Son of man is about to come in
the glory of his Father, with his angels, and then shall he render
to every one according to his doing. <sup class="v">16:28</sup>I
tell you truly, that some of those standing here shall not taste
death till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST TRANSFIGURED.&mdash;CURING A DEMONIAC, AND PAYING THE
SACRED TRIBUTE.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">17:1</sup>AND after six days
Jesus took Peter, and James, and John, his brother, and led them up
on a high mountain by themselves. <sup class="v">17:2</sup>And he
was transfigured before them, and his face shone like the sun, and
his garments were white as the light. <sup class="v">17:3</sup>And
behold there appeared to them Moses and Elijah conversing with him.
<sup class="v">17:4</sup>And Peter answered and said to Jesus,
Lord, it is good for us to be here; if you please, we will make
here three tabernacles, one for you, and one for Moses, and one for
Elijah. <sup class="v">17:5</sup>While he was yet speaking, behold
a bright cloud overshadowed them; and behold a voice from the
cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased;
hear him. <sup class="v">17:6</sup>And when they heard this the
disciples fell on their faces, and were greatly afraid. <sup class=
"v">17:7</sup>And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and
be not afraid. <sup class="v">17:8</sup>And lifting up their eyes
they saw no man, except Jesus alone.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">17:9</sup>And when they went down
from the mountain Jesus charged them, saying, Tell no man the
vision till the Son of man is raised from the dead. <sup class=
"v">17:10</sup>And the disciples asked him, saying, Why then do the
scribes say that Elijah must first come? <sup class=
"v">17:11</sup>And he answered and said, Elijah indeed comes, and
shall restore all things. <sup class="v">17:12</sup>But I tell you
Elijah has come already, and they knew him not, but did to him what
they pleased. In like manner, also, the Son of man is about to
suffer from them. <sup class="v">17:13</sup>Then the disciples
understood that he spoke to them of John the Baptist.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">17:14</sup>And when they came to
the multitude, a man came to him, kneeling to him and saying,
<sup class="v">17:15</sup>Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is a
lunatic, and suffers greatly. For he often falls into the fire, and
often into the water. <sup class="v">17:16</sup>And I brought him
to your disciples and they could not cure him. <sup class=
"v">17:17</sup>Jesus answered and said, O unbelieving and perverse
generation! How long shall I be with you? How long shall I suffer
you? Bring him here to me. <sup class="v">17:18</sup>And Jesus
rebuked him, and the demon went out of him, and the child was cured
from that hour. <sup class="v">17:19</sup>Then the disciples came
to Jesus privately, and said, Why could we not cast it out?
<sup class="v">17:20</sup>And Jesus said to them, On account of
your unbelief. For I tell you truly, if you have a faith like a
mustard seed, you shall say to this mountain, Be removed thence to
that place, and it shall be removed; and nothing shall be
impossible to you. <sup class="v">17:21</sup>But this kind goes not
out, except by prayer and fasting.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">17:22</sup>And as they were
returning in Galilee, Jesus said to them, The Son of man is about
to be delivered into the hands of men, <sup class=
"v">17:23</sup>and they will kill him, and on the third day he
shall be raised; and they were grieved exceedingly.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">17:24</sup>And when they came to
Capernaum, those who received the didrachma [28 cents], came to
Peter, and said, Does not your teacher pay the didrachma?
<sup class="v">17:25</sup>He said, Yes. And when he came into the
house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, What do you think, Simon?
From whom do the kings of the earth receive taxes, or a tribute?
From their children, or from strangers? <sup class=
"v">17:26</sup>He said to him, From strangers. Jesus said to him;
Then are the children free; <sup class="v">17:27</sup>but that we
may not offend them, go to the lake, and cast in a hook, and take
the first fish that comes up, and opening its mouth you will find a
stater [56 cents]. Take that and give it to them, for me and
you.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST'S DOCTRINE OF GREATNESS.&mdash;OFFENSES AND THE
FORGIVENESS OF SINS.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">18:1</sup>AT that time the
disciples came to Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom
of heaven? <sup class="v">18:2</sup>And calling a little child, he
set it in the midst of them, <sup class="v">18:3</sup>and said, I
tell you truly, that if you do not turn and become like little
children, you can by no means enter into the kingdom of heaven.
<sup class="v">18:4</sup>Whoever humbles himself like this little
child, shall be greatest in the kingdom of heaven; <sup class=
"v">18:5</sup>and whoever receives one such little child in my
name, receives me; <sup class="v">18:6</sup>but whoever offends one
of these little ones that believe in me, it would be better for him
that a millstone should be hung to his neck, and that he should be
plunged into the depths of the sea.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">18:7</sup>Woe to the world
because of offenses! For offenses must necessarily come, but woe to
that man by whom the offense comes! <sup class="v">18:8</sup>If
your hand or foot offends you, cut it off and cast it from you. It
is better for you to enter into life lame, or crippled, than having
two hands or two feet to be cast into the eternal fire. <sup class=
"v">18:9</sup>And if your eye offends you, pluck it out and cast it
from you. It is better for you to enter into life having one eye,
than having two eyes to be cast into the hell of fire.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">18:10</sup>See that you despise
not one of these little ones; for I tell you that their angels
always behold the face of my Father in heaven. <sup class=
"v">18:12</sup>What think you? If a man has a hundred sheep, and
one of them is lost, does he not leave the ninety-nine on the
mountain, and go and seek for the lost one? <sup class=
"v">18:13</sup>And if he finds it, I tell you truly that he
rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine which were not
lost. <sup class="v">18:14</sup>So it is not the will of your
Father in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">18:15</sup>But if your brother
sins against you, go and reprove him between you and him alone. If
he hears you, you have gained your brother. <sup class=
"v">18:16</sup>But if he does not hear you, take with you one or
two more, that by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word
may be established; <sup class="v">18:17</sup>and if he will not
hear them, tell the assembly; and if he will not hear the assembly,
let him be to you as a gentile and a publican. <sup class=
"v">18:18</sup>I tell you truly, that whatever you bind on the
earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you unbind on the
earth shall be unbound in heaven. <sup class="v">18:19</sup>Again,
I tell you, that if two of you shall agree on the earth concerning
any thing for which they shall ask, they shall have it from my
Father in heaven; <sup class="v">18:20</sup>for where two or three
are assembled together in my name, there am I in the midst of
them.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">18:21</sup>Then came Peter and
said to him, Lord, how many times shall my brother sin against me
and I forgive him? Till seven times? <sup class=
"v">18:22</sup>Jesus said to him, I say not to you till seven
times, but till seventy times seven. <sup class="v">18:23</sup>On
this account, the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wished to
settle with his servants. <sup class="v">18:24</sup>And beginning
to settle, a debtor of ten thousand talents [$10,000,000] was
brought to him. <sup class="v">18:25</sup>And he having nothing to
pay, the lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife and children,
and all that he had, and payment to be made. <sup class=
"v">18:26</sup>Then the servant fell down and worshipped him,
saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay all. <sup class=
"v">18:27</sup>And the lord of that servant having compassion on
him released him, and forgave him the debt.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">18:28</sup>But that servant went
out and found one of his fellow-servants who owed him one hundred
denarii [$14], and seizing him, he choked him, saying, Pay what you
owe me. <sup class="v">18:29</sup>Then his fellow-servant fell down
and besought him, saying, Have patience with me and I will pay you.
<sup class="v">18:30</sup>But he would not; but went and cast him
into prison till he should pay the debt. <sup class=
"v">18:31</sup>Then his fellow-servants seeing what was done, were
greatly displeased, and went and related to their lord all things
that were done. <sup class="v">18:32</sup>Then his lord called him,
and said to him, Evil servant; I forgave you all that debt because
you besought me [to do it]. <sup class="v">18:33</sup>Ought you not
also to pity your fellow-servant, as I pitied you? <sup class=
"v">18:34</sup>And his lord was displeased, and delivered him to
the tormentors till he should pay all the debt. <sup class=
"v">18:35</sup>So also will my heavenly Father do to you, if you
forgive not each one his brother from your hearts.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST'S DOCTRINE OF MARRIAGE, DIVORCE, ETC.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">19:1</sup>AND when Jesus had
finished these words he departed from Galilee, and came into the
bounds of Judea beyond the Jordan; <sup class="v">19:2</sup>and
great multitudes followed him, and he cured them there. <sup class=
"v">19:3</sup>And the Pharisees came to him to try him, and said,
Is it lawful [for a man] to put away his wife for every cause?
<sup class="v">19:4</sup>And he answered and said, Have you not
read that the Creator at the beginning made them male and female?
<sup class="v">19:5</sup>and he said, On this account shall a man
leave his father and mother, and be joined to his wife, and the two
shall be one flesh. <sup class="v">19:6</sup>So that they are no
longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has yoked together,
let not man separate.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">19:7</sup>They said to him, Why
then did Moses command us to give a bill of divorcement, and put
her away? <sup class="v">19:8</sup>He said to them, Moses, on
account of your hardness of heart, allowed you to put away your
wives; but from the beginning it was not so. <sup class=
"v">19:9</sup>And I tell you, that whoever puts away his wife,
except for adultery, and marries another, commits adultery; and
whoever marries her that is put away, commits adultery.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">19:10</sup>The disciples said to
him, If the case of a man is thus with his wife, it is not
expedient to marry. <sup class="v">19:11</sup>And he said to them,
All do not receive this word, but those to whom it is given.
<sup class="v">19:12</sup>For there are eunuchs from birth, who
were born so from their mother; and there are eunuchs who are made
eunuchs by men; and there are eunuchs who have made themselves
eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. He that is able to
receive [this doctrine] let him receive it.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">19:13</sup>Then little children
were brought to him that he should put his hands on them and pray;
and the disciples rebuked them. <sup class="v">19:14</sup>But Jesus
said, Suffer the little children to come to me, and forbid them
not, for of such is the kingdom of heaven. <sup class=
"v">19:15</sup>And he put his hands on them and departed
thence.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">19:16</sup>And behold one came
and said to him, Teacher, what good [work] shall I do that I may
have eternal life? <sup class="v">19:17</sup>And he said to him,
Why do you ask me of the good? one is the good. But if you wish to
enter into life, keep the commandments. <sup class=
"v">19:18</sup>He said to him, What? And Jesus said, this; You
shall not kill; You shall not commit adultery; You shall not steal;
You shall not testify falsely; <sup class="v">19:19</sup>Honor your
father and mother; and you shall love your neighbor as yourself.
<sup class="v">19:20</sup>The young man said to him, All these have
I kept; what do I lack yet? <sup class="v">19:21</sup>Jesus said to
him, If you will be perfect, go and sell your property, and give to
the poor, and you shall have a treasure in heaven; and come and
follow me. <sup class="v">19:22</sup>And when the young man heard
[this] he went away sad, for he had great possessions.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">19:23</sup>And Jesus said to his
disciples, I tell you truly, that a rich man will enter into the
kingdom of heaven with difficulty. <sup class="v">19:24</sup>And
again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of
a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
<sup class="v">19:25</sup>And the disciples hearing this, were
greatly astonished, and said, Who then can be saved? <sup class=
"v">19:26</sup>But Jesus looking on them, said, With men this is
impossible; but with God all things are possible.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">19:27</sup>Then Peter answered
and said, Behold we have left all and followed you; what shall we
have therefore? <sup class="v">19:28</sup>And Jesus said to them, I
tell you truly, that you who have followed me, in the regeneration
when the Son of man shall sit on the throne of his glory, shall
yourselves also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of
Israel; <sup class="v">19:29</sup>and whoever has left brothers or
sisters, or a father or mother, or children, or lands or houses,
for my name's sake, shall receive many times as much, and inherit
eternal life. <sup class="v">19:30</sup>But many first shall be
last; and last, first.</p>
<p class="pin">8 <sup class="v">20:1</sup>For the kingdom of
heaven is like a householder who went out early in the morning to
hire laborers in his vineyard. <sup class="v">20:2</sup>And
agreeing with the laborers for a denarius [14 cents] a day, he sent
them into his vineyard. <sup class="v">20:3</sup>And going out
about the third hour, he saw others standing idle in the market;
<sup class="v">20:4</sup>and he said to them, go also into the
vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you. And they went.
<sup class="v">20:5</sup>Again going out about the sixth and ninth
hours, he did likewise. <sup class="v">20:6</sup>And going out
about the eleventh hour he found others standing, and said to them,
Why stand you all the day idle? <sup class="v">20:7</sup>They said
to him, Because no man has hired us. He said to them, Go also into
the vineyard. <sup class="v">20:8</sup>And when it was evening the
lord of the vineyard said to his steward, Call the laborers, and
pay them the wages [stipulated], beginning from the last even to
the first. <sup class="v">20:9</sup>And those who came about the
eleventh hour, received a denarius [14 cents] each. <sup class=
"v">20:10</sup>And those who came first supposed that they should
receive more. And they also received a denarius [14 cents] each;
<sup class="v">20:11</sup>and when they had received it, they
complained of the householder, <sup class="v">20:12</sup>saying,
These last have worked but one hour, and you have made them equal
with us, who have borne the burden and heat of the day. <sup class=
"v">20:13</sup>But he answered and said to one of them, Neighbor, I
do you no wrong. Did you not agree with me for a denarius [14
cents]? <sup class="v">20:14</sup>Take what belongs to you, and go,
for I will give to the last even as to you. <sup class=
"v">20:15</sup>Is it not right for me to do what I will with my
own? Is your eye evil because I am good? <sup class=
"v">20:16</sup>So the last shall be first, and the first last.</p>
<p class="pin">9 <sup class="v">20:17</sup>And Jesus going up to
Jerusalem, took his twelve disciples aside privately, and said to
them on the way, <sup class="v">20:18</sup>Behold we go up to
Jerusalem, and the Son of man will be delivered to the chief
priests and scribes, and they will condemn him to death,
<sup class="v">20:19</sup>and deliver him to the gentiles, to mock,
and scourge, and crucify him; and on the third day he shall be
raised.</p>
<p class="pin">10 <sup class="v">20:20</sup>Then came to him the
mother of Zebedee's children with her sons, worshipping, and asking
a certain thing of him. <sup class="v">20:21</sup>And he said to
her, What do you wish? She said to him, Say that these my two sons
shall sit, one on your right hand, and the other on your left, in
your kingdom. <sup class="v">20:22</sup>But Jesus answered and
said, You know not what you ask. Can you drink of the cup of which
I am about to drink? They said to him, We can. <sup class=
"v">20:23</sup>He said to them; you shall drink indeed of my cup;
but to sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine to give,
but to those for whom it is prepared by my Father. <sup class=
"v">20:24</sup>And the ten hearing this were displeased with the
two brothers. <sup class="v">20:25</sup>But Jesus called them to
him, and said, You know that the rulers of the gentiles exercise
lordship over them, and the great exercise authority over them; but
it shall not be so among you. <sup class="v">20:26</sup>But whoever
wishes to be great among you, let him be your minister; <sup class=
"v">20:27</sup>and whoever wishes to be first among you, let him be
your servant, <sup class="v">20:28</sup>as the Son of man came not
to be served, but to serve, and to give his life a ransom for
many.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST CURING TWO BLIND MEN.&mdash;ENTERING JERUSALEM IN
TRIUMPH, AND CURSING THE FIG TREE.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">20:29</sup>AND as they proceeded
from Jericho a great multitude followed him. <sup class=
"v">20:30</sup>And behold two blind men who sat by the way, hearing
that Jesus was passing by cried, saying, Have mercy on us Lord, Son
of David! <sup class="v">20:31</sup>And the multitude charged them
to be still; but they cried the more, saying, Have mercy on us
Lord, Son of David! <sup class="v">20:32</sup>And Jesus stopped,
and called them and said, What do you wish me to do for you?
<sup class="v">20:33</sup>They said to him, Lord, that our eyes may
be opened. <sup class="v">20:34</sup>And Jesus having compassion on
them, touched their eyes; and immediately they recovered their
sight and followed him.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">21:1</sup>And when they
approached Jerusalem, and came to Bethphage, at the Mount of
Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples, <sup class="v">21:2</sup>and
said to them, Go into the village opposite to you, and you will
immediately find an ass tied, and a colt with her; untie them, and
lead them to me: <sup class="v">21:3</sup>and if any one asks you
why, say that the Lord has need of them, and he will immediately
send them. <sup class="v">21:4</sup>But all this was done that the
words spoken by the prophet might be fulfilled, who says;
<sup class="v">21:5</sup>Tell the daughter of Zion, Behold, your
king comes to you, meek, seated on an ass, and a colt the foal of
an ass.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">21:6</sup>And the disciples went
and did as Jesus commanded them, <sup class="v">21:7</sup>and
brought the ass and the colt, and put garments on them, and he sat
on them. <sup class="v">21:8</sup>And a vast multitude spread their
garments in the way, and others cut branches from the trees and
scattered them in the way; <sup class="v">21:9</sup>and the
multitudes that went before, and those that followed, cried saying,
Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is he that comes in the name
of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest [heavens]!</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">21:10</sup>And when he entered
Jerusalem the whole city was moved, saying, Who is this?
<sup class="v">21:11</sup>And the multitude said, This is Jesus,
the prophet who is from Nazareth of Galilee. <sup class=
"v">21:12</sup>And Jesus entered into the temple of God, and cast
out all that sold and bought in the temple, and overturned the
tables of the brokers, and the seats of those that sold doves,
<sup class="v">21:13</sup>and said to them, It is written, my house
shall be called a house of prayer; but you make it a den of
robbers.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">21:14</sup>And the blind and
crippled came to him in the temple, and he cured them. <sup class=
"v">21:15</sup>And when the chief priests and scribes saw the
wonderful works which he performed, and the children crying in the
temple and saying, Hosanna to the Son of David! they were
displeased, <sup class="v">21:16</sup>and said to him, Do you hear
what these say? And Jesus said to them, Yes. Have you never read,
that out of the mouths of babes and nursing infants, you have
perfected praise? <sup class="v">21:17</sup>And he left them, and
went out of the city to Bethany, and lodged there.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">21:18</sup>And returning into the
city in the morning he was hungry; <sup class="v">21:19</sup>and
seeing a fig tree by the way he went to it, and found nothing on
it, except leaves only, and he said to it, Let there be no fruit on
you forever. And the fig tree immediately withered, <sup class=
"v">21:20</sup>and the disciples seeing it, wondered and said, How
soon is this fig tree withered! <sup class="v">21:21</sup>Jesus
answered and said to them, I tell you truly, that if you have faith
and doubt not, you shall not only do this of the fig tree, but if
you should say to this mountain, Be taken up and be cast into the
sea, it would be done; <sup class="v">21:22</sup>and all things
whatever which you ask in prayer believing, you shall receive.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST QUESTIONED BY THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND ELDERS. THE PARABLE
OF THE VINEYARD.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">21:23</sup>AND Jesus having gone
into the temple, the chief priests and elders of the people came to
him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority do you do these
things? and who gave you this authority? <sup class=
"v">21:24</sup>Jesus answered and said to them, I also will ask you
one question, which, if you tell me, I will tell you by what
authority I do these things. <sup class="v">21:25</sup>Whence was
the baptism of John? from heaven or from men? And they reasoned
within themselves, saying, If we say from heaven, he will say to
us, Why did you not believe him? <sup class="v">21:26</sup>But if
we say from men, we fear the multitude, for all regard John as a
prophet. <sup class="v">21:27</sup>And they answered Jesus, and
said, We do not know. And he said to them, Neither do I tell you by
what authority I do these things.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">21:28</sup>But what do you think?
A man had two sons; and he went to the first, and said, Son, go and
work to-day in the vineyard. <sup class="v">21:29</sup>But he
answered and said, I will not; but afterwards he repented, and
went. <sup class="v">21:30</sup>And he came to the other, and said
the same. And he answered and said, I will go sir, but went not.
<sup class="v">21:31</sup>Which of the two did the will of the
father? They said to him, The first. Jesus said to them, I tell you
truly, that the publicans and harlots go into the kingdom of God
before you. <sup class="v">21:32</sup>For John came to you in a way
of righteousness, and you believed him not; but the publicans and
harlots believed him; and when you saw this, you did not afterwards
repent, that you might believe him.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">21:33</sup>Hear another parable:
There was a man, a householder, who planted a vineyard, and made a
hedge around it, and dug a wine vat in it, and built a tower, and
let it out to husbandmen, and went abroad. <sup class=
"v">21:34</sup>And when the time of the fruits approached he sent
his servants to the husbandmen to receive his fruits. <sup class=
"v">21:35</sup>And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one,
and killed another, and stoned another. <sup class=
"v">21:36</sup>Again he sent other servants more than the first;
and they treated them in the same manner. <sup class=
"v">21:37</sup>And afterwards he sent them his son, saying, They
will reverence my son. <sup class="v">21:38</sup>But when the
husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the
heir; come, let us kill him and take his inheritance. <sup class=
"v">21:39</sup>And they took him, and cast him out of the vineyard,
and killed him. <sup class="v">21:40</sup>When, therefore, the lord
of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those husbandmen?
<sup class="v">21:41</sup>They said to him, He will inflict on
those men a miserable death, and let out his vineyard to other
husbandmen, who will render him the fruits in their seasons.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">21:42</sup>Jesus said to them,
Have you never read in the Scriptures, The stone which the builders
rejected, the same has become the head of a corner? this is from
the Lord, and is wonderful in our eyes? <sup class="v">21:43</sup>I
tell you, therefore, that the kingdom of God shall be taken from
you, and given to a nation yielding its fruits.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">21:45</sup>And the chief priests
and Pharisees hearing his parables, knew that he spoke of them;
<sup class="v">21:46</sup>and they sought to take him, but feared
the people, because they regarded him as a prophet.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2>
<h3>THE PARABLE OF THE WEDDING, AND QUESTIONS OF THE PHARISEES AND
SADDUCEES.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">22:1</sup>AND Jesus answered and
spoke to them again in parables saying, <sup class=
"v">22:2</sup>The kingdom of heaven is like a man, a king, who made
a wedding for his son. <sup class="v">22:3</sup>And he sent his
servants to call the invited to the wedding, and they would not
come. <sup class="v">22:4</sup>Again he sent other servants,
saying, Tell the invited, Behold, I have prepared my supper, my
oxen and fatted creatures are killed, and all things are ready;
come to the wedding. <sup class="v">22:5</sup>But they neglected
it, and went away, one to his farm, and another to his merchandise;
<sup class="v">22:6</sup>and the rest took his servants and treated
them injuriously, and killed them. <sup class="v">22:7</sup>And the
king was angry, and sent his armies and destroyed those murderers,
and burnt up their city.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">22:8</sup>Then he said to his
servants, The wedding indeed is ready, but the invited were not
worthy. <sup class="v">22:9</sup>Go, therefore, to the crossings of
the ways, and invite all you find to the wedding. <sup class=
"v">22:10</sup>And those servants went out into the highways, and
collected all whom they found, both bad and good, and the wedding
was furnished with guests.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">22:11</sup>And the king coming in
to see the guests observed there a man who had not on a wedding
garment, <sup class="v">22:12</sup>and said to him, Friend, how
came you in here not having a wedding garment? And he was
speechless. <sup class="v">22:13</sup>Then the king said to the
servants, Bind his feet and hands, and cast him into the darkness
outside. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. <sup class=
"v">22:14</sup>For many are called, but few chosen.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">22:15</sup>Then the Pharisees
went and took counsel to ensnare him in his words. <sup class=
"v">22:16</sup>And they sent to him their disciples, with the
Herodians, saying, Teacher, we know that you are true, and teach
the way of God in truth, and care not for any man; for you regard
not the face of men. <sup class="v">22:17</sup>Tell us, therefore,
what you think; is it right to pay tribute to C&aelig;sar or not?
<sup class="v">22:18</sup>Jesus knowing their wickedness, said, Why
do you hypocrites try me? <sup class="v">22:19</sup>Show me the
tribute money. And they brought him a denarius [14 cents].
<sup class="v">22:20</sup>And he said to them, Whose is this image
and this inscription? <sup class="v">22:21</sup>They said to him,
C&aelig;sar's. Then he said to them, Give therefore C&aelig;sar's
dues to C&aelig;sar, and God's to God. <sup class=
"v">22:22</sup>And hearing, they wondered, and went away and left
him.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">22:23</sup>On that day the
Sadducees came to him, who say there is no resurrection, and asked
him, <sup class="v">22:24</sup>saying, Teacher, Moses said, If any
one dies having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and
raise up children for his brother. <sup class="v">22:25</sup>Now
there were with us seven brothers; and the first married, and died;
and having no children he left his wife to his brother; <sup class=
"v">22:26</sup>in like manner also the second, and third, till the
seventh; <sup class="v">22:27</sup>last of all the woman died also.
<sup class="v">22:28</sup>In the resurrection, therefore, whose
wife will she be of the seven? for they all had her. <sup class=
"v">22:29</sup>And Jesus answered and said to them, You err, not
knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God. <sup class=
"v">22:30</sup>For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are
married, but are as angels in heaven. <sup class="v">22:31</sup>But
concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was
spoken to you by God, saying, <sup class="v">22:32</sup>I am the
God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is
not a God of the dead, but of the living. <sup class=
"v">22:33</sup>And the multitudes who heard were astonished at his
teaching.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">22:34</sup>And the Pharisees
hearing that he had silenced the Sadducees, were assembled
together, <sup class="v">22:35</sup>and one of them, a lawyer,
asked him, to try him, <sup class="v">22:36</sup>Teacher, what is
the great commandment in the law? <sup class="v">22:37</sup>And he
said to him, You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart,
and all your soul, and all your mind. <sup class=
"v">22:38</sup>This is the great and first commandment. <sup class=
"v">22:39</sup>And the second is like it, You shall love your
neighbor as yourself. <sup class="v">22:40</sup>On these two
commandments hang all the law and the prophets.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">22:41</sup>And the Pharisees
being assembled together, Jesus asked them, <sup class=
"v">22:42</sup>saying, What do you think of the Christ? whose son
is he? They said to him, David's. <sup class="v">22:43</sup>He said
to them, How then does David in spirit call him Lord, saying,
<sup class="v">22:44</sup>The Lord said to my Lord, Sit on my right
hand till I make your enemies your footstool? <sup class=
"v">22:45</sup>If then David calls him Lord, how is he his son?
<sup class="v">22:46</sup>And no one was able to answer him a word,
neither dared any one after that day to question him farther.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST DENOUNCING THE SCRIBES AND PHARISEES.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">23:1</sup>THEN Jesus spoke to the
multitudes and his disciples, <sup class="v">23:2</sup>saying, The
scribes and Pharisees sit in Moses' seat. <sup class=
"v">23:3</sup>All things therefore which they tell you, do and
keep. But do not their works. For they say and do not, <sup class=
"v">23:4</sup>but bind heavy burdens and put them on the shoulders
of men, but will not move them with their finger. <sup class=
"v">23:5</sup>And they do all their works to be seen by men. For
they make broad their prayer fillets, and enlarge the fringes,
<sup class="v">23:6</sup>and love the first tables at feasts, and
the first seats in the synagogues, <sup class="v">23:7</sup>and
salutations in the markets, and to be called by men, Rabbi.
<sup class="v">23:8</sup>But do not you be called Rabbi; For one is
your teacher, and you are all brothers. <sup class=
"v">23:9</sup>And call no man your father on the earth, for one is
your heavenly Father. <sup class="v">23:10</sup>Neither be called
leaders, for one is your leader, the Christ. <sup class=
"v">23:11</sup>But the greatest of you shall be your servant,
<sup class="v">23:12</sup>and whoever exalts himself shall be
humbled, and he that humbles himself shall be exalted.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">23:13</sup>But woe to you scribes
and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you shut up the kingdom of heaven
before men; for you enter not into it, neither do you suffer those
entering to go in. <sup class="v">23:15</sup>Woe to you scribes and
Pharisees, hypocrites! For you compass the sea and the dry land to
make one proselyte; and when he is gained you make him twice as
much a child of hell as yourselves. <sup class="v">23:16</sup>Woe
to you blind guides, who say, Whoever swears by the temple, it is
nothing; but whoever swears by the gold of the temple, he is bound.
<sup class="v">23:17</sup>Fools and blind! for which is greater,
the gold, or the temple which sanctifies the gold? <sup class=
"v">23:18</sup>If a man swears by the altar, it is nothing; but if
he swears by the gift which is on it, he is bound. <sup class=
"v">23:19</sup>Fools and blind! For which is greater, the gift, or
the altar which sanctifies the gift? <sup class="v">23:20</sup>He
then that swears by the altar, swears by it, and by all things on
it; <sup class="v">23:21</sup>and he that swears by the temple,
swears by it, and by him that inhabits it; <sup class=
"v">23:22</sup>and he that swears by heaven, swears by the throne
of God, and by him that sits on it.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">23:23</sup>Woe to you scribes and
Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe mint, and anise, and cummin,
and have neglected the weightier matters of the law, justice,
mercy, and faith. These you ought to do, and not neglect the
others. <sup class="v">23:24</sup>Blind guides! who strain out a
gnat and swallow down a camel. <sup class="v">23:25</sup>Woe to you
scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you cleanse the outside of
the cup and platter, but within they are full of plunder and
excess. <sup class="v">23:26</sup>Blind Pharisee! cleanse first
that which is in the cup and platter, that its outside may be clean
also. <sup class="v">23:27</sup>Woe to you scribes and Pharisees,
hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs, which appear fair
without, but within are full of the bones of the dead and of all
impurity. <sup class="v">23:28</sup>So also you on the outside
appear just to men, but within you are full of hypocrisy and
wickedness. <sup class="v">23:29</sup>Woe to you scribes and
Pharisees, hypocrites! For you build the tombs of the prophets, and
adorn the tombs of the righteous, <sup class="v">23:30</sup>and
say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have
been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets. <sup class=
"v">23:31</sup>So that you testify to yourselves that you are
children of those who killed the prophets; <sup class=
"v">23:32</sup>and you have filled up the measure of your fathers.
<sup class="v">23:33</sup>Serpents, offspring of vipers! How can
you escape the judgment of hell?</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">23:34</sup>Therefore, behold, I
send you prophets, and wise men, and scribes. Some of them you will
kill and crucify; and some of them you will scourge in your
synagogues, and persecute from city to city; <sup class=
"v">23:35</sup>that all the righteous blood shed on the earth, from
the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zachariah, son of
Bararchiah, whom you killed between the temple and the altar, may
come upon you. <sup class="v">23:36</sup>I tell you truly, that all
these [crimes] shall come on this generation.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">23:37</sup>Jerusalem, Jerusalem,
killing the prophets, and stoning those sent to you, how often
would I have gathered your children together, as a bird gathers her
brood under her wings, but you would not! <sup class=
"v">23:38</sup>Behold, your house is left to you desolate;
<sup class="v">23:39</sup>for I tell you that you shall not see me
henceforth, till you say, Blessed is he that comes in the name of
the Lord!</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST PREDICTING THE DESTRUCTION OF JERUSALEM, AND THE
ESTABLISHMENT OF HIS KINGDOM.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">24:1</sup>AND Jesus went out and
departed from the temple; and his disciples came to him to show him
the buildings of the temple. <sup class="v">24:2</sup>And he
answered and said to them, Do you not see all these things? I tell
you truly, there shall not be left here stone upon stone that shall
not be thrown down. <sup class="v">24:3</sup>And as he sat on the
Mount of Olives the disciples came to him privately, saying, Tell
us when these things shall be; and what shall be the sign of your
coming, and of the consummation of the world? <sup class=
"v">24:4</sup>And Jesus answered and said to them, See that no man
deceives you; <sup class="v">24:5</sup>for many shall come in my
name, saying, I am the Christ, and shall deceive many. <sup class=
"v">24:6</sup>And you shall hear of wars and rumors of wars; see
that you be not terrified, for all things must be accomplished; but
the end is not yet. <sup class="v">24:7</sup>For nation shall rise
against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there shall be
famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in different places;
<sup class="v">24:8</sup>but all these things are the beginning of
sorrows.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">24:9</sup>Then they shall deliver
you to affliction, and kill you, and you shall be hated by all
nations on my account; <sup class="v">24:10</sup>and then many
shall be offended, and shall betray one another, and hate one
another; <sup class="v">24:11</sup>and many false prophets shall be
raised up and deceive many, <sup class="v">24:12</sup>and because
wickedness shall abound the love of the many shall become cold:
<sup class="v">24:13</sup>but he that endures to the end shall be
saved. <sup class="v">24:14</sup>And this good news of the kingdom
shall be preached in all the world, for a testimony to all nations;
and then shall the end come.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">24:15</sup>When, therefore, you
see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet,
standing in a holy place&mdash;let him that reads
understand,&mdash; <sup class="v">24:16</sup>then let those in
Judea flee to the mountains. <sup class="v">24:17</sup>Let not him
that is on his house come down to take the things from his house;
<sup class="v">24:18</sup>and let not him that is in the field
return back to take his clothes; <sup class="v">24:19</sup>and woe
to those with child and giving nurse in those days! <sup class=
"v">24:20</sup>But pray that your flight may not be in the winter,
nor on the Sabbath; <sup class="v">24:21</sup>for at that time
there shall be great affliction, such as has not been from the
beginning of the world even till now, nor ever shall be.
<sup class="v">24:22</sup>And unless those days were shortened no
flesh would be saved: but on account of the elect those days shall
be shortened.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">24:23</sup>Then if one says to
you, Behold, here is the Christ, or there! believe it not.
<sup class="v">24:24</sup>For false Christs and false prophets
shall be raised up, and shall show great signs and wonders, so as
to deceive, if possible, even the elect. <sup class=
"v">24:25</sup>Behold, I have told you before. <sup class=
"v">24:26</sup>If, therefore, they say to you, Behold he is in the
wilderness, go not forth; Behold he is in private rooms, believe it
not. <sup class="v">24:27</sup>For as the lightning comes forth
from the East, and shines even to the West, so shall the coming of
the Son of man be. <sup class="v">24:28</sup>Wherever the dead body
is, there will the eagles be gathered together.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">24:29</sup>And immediately after
the affliction of those days the sun shall be darkened, and the
moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from
heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken. <sup class=
"v">24:30</sup>And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in
heaven; and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn; and they
shall see the Son of man coming on the clouds of heaven, with power
and great glory. <sup class="v">24:31</sup>And he shall send his
angels with a loud sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather his
elect from the four winds, from the one end of heaven to the
other.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">24:32</sup>But learn the parable
of the fig tree. When its branch is now green, and puts forth
leaves, you know that the summer is nigh. <sup class=
"v">24:33</sup>So also when you see all these things, know that
[the Son of man] is nigh, at the doors. <sup class="v">24:34</sup>I
tell you truly, that this generation shall not pass away till all
these things shall be accomplished. <sup class=
"v">24:35</sup>Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall
not pass away.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">24:36</sup>But of that day and
hour no man knows, nor the angels of heaven; but my Father only.
<sup class="v">24:37</sup>And as the days of Noah, so shall the
coming of the Son of man be. <sup class="v">24:38</sup>For as in
the days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying
and giving in marriage, till the day that Noah entered the ark,
<sup class="v">24:39</sup>and knew not till the flood came and took
them all away, so shall the coming of the Son of man be.
<sup class="v">24:40</sup>Then two shall be in the field; one is
taken and the other left. <sup class="v">24:41</sup>Two women shall
be grinding at the mill; one is taken and the other left.</p>
<p class="pin">8 <sup class="v">24:42</sup>Watch, therefore, for
you know not on what day your Lord comes, <sup class=
"v">24:43</sup>But know this, that if the householder had known in
what watch the thief comes, he would have watched, and not have
suffered his house to be broken into. <sup class=
"v">24:44</sup>Therefore be you also ready, for in such an hour as
you think not the Son of man comes. <sup class="v">24:45</sup>Who
then is the faithful and wise servant whom the Lord has placed over
his family to give them food in due season? <sup class=
"v">24:46</sup>Blessed is that servant whom his Lord, when he
comes, shall find so doing. <sup class="v">24:47</sup>I tell you
truly, that he will place him over all his estates.</p>
<p class="pin">9 <sup class="v">24:48</sup>But if that evil
servant says in his heart, My Lord delays his coming, <sup class=
"v">24:49</sup>and begins to beat his fellow-servants, and eats and
drinks with drunkards, <sup class="v">24:50</sup>the Lord of that
servant will come on a day when he looks not for him, and at an
hour that he knows not of, <sup class="v">24:51</sup>and will
punish him with the utmost severity, and appoint his portion with
hypocrites. There shall be weeping and gnashing of the teeth.</p>
<p class="pin">10 <sup class="v">25:1</sup>Then the kingdom of
heaven shall be likened to ten virgins who took their own lamps and
went out to meet the bridegroom; <sup class="v">25:2</sup>and five
of them were foolish, and five wise. <sup class="v">25:3</sup>The
foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them; <sup class=
"v">25:4</sup>but the wise took oil in the vessels with their
lamps. <sup class="v">25:5</sup>And while the bridegroom delayed,
all slumbered and slept; <sup class="v">25:6</sup>but at midnight
there was a cry, Behold the bridegroom; go out to meet him.
<sup class="v">25:7</sup>Then all those virgins arose and trimmed
their own lamps. <sup class="v">25:8</sup>And the foolish said to
the wise, Give us of your oil, for our lamps have gone out.
<sup class="v">25:9</sup>But the wise answered, saying, [No]; lest
there be not enough for us and you; go rather to those that sell,
and buy for yourselves. <sup class="v">25:10</sup>And while they
went to buy the bridegroom came; and the ready went in with him to
the wedding, and the door was shut. <sup class="v">25:11</sup>And
afterwards the other virgins came, and said, Lord, Lord, open to
us. <sup class="v">25:12</sup>But he answered and said, I tell you
truly I know you not. <sup class="v">25:13</sup>Watch, therefore,
for you know not the day nor the hour.</p>
<p class="pin">11 <sup class="v">25:14</sup>For, as a man going
abroad called his servants, and delivered to them his estates;
<sup class="v">25:15</sup>to one he gave five talents [$5,000], to
another two [$2,000], and to another one [$1,000]; to each
according to his ability, and immediately went abroad. <sup class=
"v">25:16</sup>And he that received the five talents went and
traded with them, and made other five; <sup class="v">25:17</sup>in
like manner, also, he that received the two gained two others;
<sup class="v">25:18</sup>but he that received the one went away
and dug in the earth and hid his lord's money. <sup class=
"v">25:19</sup>And after a long time the lord of those servants
came, and had a settlement with them. <sup class="v">25:20</sup>And
he that received the five talents came and brought five other
talents, saying, Lord, you committed to me five talents; behold, I
have gained five other talents. <sup class="v">25:21</sup>His lord
said to him, Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been
faithful over a few [talents], I will place you over many: enter
into the joy of your lord. <sup class="v">25:22</sup>And he that
received the two talents also came to him and said, Lord, you
committed to me two talents; behold, I have gained two others.
<sup class="v">25:23</sup>His Lord said to him, Well done, good and
faithful servant; you have been faithful over a few [talents], I
will place you over many: enter into the joy of your lord.</p>
<p class="pin">12 <sup class="v">25:24</sup>And he that received
the one talent also came and said, Lord, I knew you that you are a
hard man, reaping where you have not sowed, and gathering where you
have not scattered, <sup class="v">25:25</sup>and being afraid I
went away and hid your talent in the earth; behold, you have what
is yours. <sup class="v">25:26</sup>And his Lord answered and said
to him, Evil and slothful servant, you knew that I reap where I
have not sowed, and gather whence I have not scattered? <sup class=
"v">25:27</sup>And you ought then to have given my money to the
brokers, and at my coming, I should have received my own with
interest. <sup class="v">25:28</sup>Take his talent, therefore,
from him, and give it to him that has ten talents; <sup class=
"v">25:29</sup>for to every one that has shall be given, and he
shall have an abundance; but from him that has not, even what he
has shall be taken away; <sup class="v">25:30</sup>and cast the
unprofitable servant into the darkness outside; there shall be
weeping and gnashing of the teeth.</p>
<p class="pin">13 <sup class="v">25:31</sup>But when the Son of
man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then shall he
sit on the throne of his glory, <sup class="v">25:32</sup>and all
the nations shall be assembled before him, and he shall separate
them one from another, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the
goats; <sup class="v">25:33</sup>and he shall place the sheep on
his right hand, and the goats on his left.</p>
<p class="pin">14 <sup class="v">25:34</sup>Then shall the king
say to those on his right hand, Come, blessed of my Father, inherit
the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world;
<sup class="v">25:35</sup>for I was hungry and you gave me food; I
was thirsty and you gave me drink; I was a stranger and you took me
in; <sup class="v">25:36</sup>naked and you clothed me; I was sick
and you visited me; I was in prison, and you came to me.
<sup class="v">25:37</sup>Then shall the righteous answer him,
saying, Lord, when did we see you hungry, and feed you? or thirsty,
and give you drink? <sup class="v">25:38</sup>when did we see you a
stranger, and take you in? or naked, and clothe you? <sup class=
"v">25:39</sup>when did we see you sick, or in prison, and come to
you? <sup class="v">25:40</sup>And the king shall answer and say to
them, I tell you truly, that inasmuch as you have done it to one of
the least of these my brothers, you have done it to me.</p>
<p class="pin">15 <sup class="v">25:41</sup>Then shall he say to
those on his left hand, Depart from me accursed, into the eternal
fire prepared for the devil and his angels. <sup class=
"v">25:42</sup>For I was hungry and you gave me no food; I was
thirsty and you gave me no drink; <sup class="v">25:43</sup>a
stranger, and you took me not in; sick and in prison and you
visited me not. <sup class="v">25:44</sup>Then shall they also
answer and say, Lord, when did we see you hungry, or thirsty, or a
stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not serve you?
<sup class="v">25:45</sup>Then he shall answer them saying, I tell
you truly, that inasmuch as you have not done it to one of the
least of these my brothers, you have not done it to me. <sup class=
"v">25:46</sup>And these shall go away into eternal punishment, but
the righteous into life eternal.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST AT BETHANY, THE PASCHAL AND LORD'S SUPPER, ETC.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">26:1</sup>WHEN Jesus had finished
all these words he said to his disciples, <sup class=
"v">26:2</sup>You know that after two days is the passover, and the
Son of man is delivered up to be crucified. <sup class=
"v">26:3</sup>Then the chief priests and the elders of the people
were assembled in the court of the chief priest, who was called
Caiaphas, <sup class="v">26:4</sup>and they took counsel to seize
Jesus by stratagem, and kill him. <sup class="v">26:5</sup>But they
said, Not at the feast, lest there be a tumult among the
people.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">26:6</sup>And Jesus being at
Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, <sup class=
"v">26:7</sup>a woman came to him having a vase of very costly
ointment, and poured it on his head, as he reclined. <sup class=
"v">26:8</sup>And his disciples seeing it were displeased, and
said, Why is this waste? <sup class="v">26:9</sup>This could have
been sold for much and given to the poor. <sup class=
"v">26:10</sup>But Jesus knowing it, said to them, Why do you
trouble the woman? for she has done a good work for me; <sup class=
"v">26:11</sup>for the poor you always have with you, but me you
have not always. <sup class="v">26:12</sup>For in putting this
ointment on my body, she has done it to prepare me for burial.
<sup class="v">26:13</sup>I tell you truly, that wherever this good
news is preached in all the word, what this woman has done shall be
told for a memorial of her.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">26:14</sup>Then went one of the
twelve called Judas Iscariot to the chief priests, <sup class=
"v">26:15</sup>and said, What will you give me to deliver him to
you? And they gave him thirty [shekels] of silver [$16.80].
<sup class="v">26:16</sup>And from that time he sought a good
opportunity to deliver him up. <sup class="v">26:17</sup>And on the
first day of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying,
Where do you wish us to prepare for you to eat the passover?
<sup class="v">26:18</sup>And he said, Go into the city to such a
one, and say to him, The Teacher says, My time is at hand; I will
keep the passover with you, together with my disciples. <sup class=
"v">26:19</sup>And the disciples did as Jesus commanded them, and
prepared the passover; <sup class="v">26:20</sup>and when it was
evening he reclined with the twelve. <sup class="v">26:21</sup>And
as they were eating, he said, I tell you truly, that one of you
will betray me. <sup class="v">26:22</sup>And being grieved
exceedingly, they each one began to say to him, Lord, is it I?
<sup class="v">26:23</sup>But he answered and said, He that dips
his hand with me in the dish, he shall betray me. <sup class=
"v">26:24</sup>The Son of man goes indeed, as it is written of him,
but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it would be
good for him if that man had not been born. <sup class=
"v">26:25</sup>And Judas, who betrayed him, answered and said, Is
it I, Rabbi? He said to him, As you say.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">26:26</sup>And as they were
eating Jesus took the bread, and having blessed, broke and gave to
the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body. <sup class=
"v">26:27</sup>And taking the cup, and giving thanks, he gave it to
them, saying, Drink you all of it; <sup class="v">26:28</sup>this
is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many for
the forgiveness of sins. <sup class="v">26:29</sup>And I tell you
that I will not drink henceforth of this product of the vine, till
that day when I drink it with you new in the kingdom of my Father.
<sup class="v">26:30</sup>And having sung a hymn they went out to
the Mount of Olives.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">26:31</sup>Then Jesus said to
them, You will all be offended with me this night; for it is
written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock
shall be scattered; <sup class="v">26:32</sup>but after I have
risen I will go before you into Galilee. <sup class=
"v">26:33</sup>And Peter answered and said to him, If all men shall
be offended with you, I will not. <sup class="v">26:34</sup>Jesus
said to him, I tell you truly, that this night, before the cock
crows, you will deny me thrice. <sup class="v">26:35</sup>Peter
said to him, If it should be necessary for me to die with you, I
will by no means deny you. And all the disciples said the same.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST IN GETHSEMANE, AND BEFORE THE SANHEDRIM.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">26:36</sup>THEN Jesus went with
them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to the disciples, Sit
here, till I go and pray there. <sup class="v">26:37</sup>And
taking Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be sorrowful
and dejected. <sup class="v">26:38</sup>Then he said to them, My
soul is sorrowful even to death; remain here and watch with me.
<sup class="v">26:39</sup>And going forward a little, he fell on
his face, and prayed and said, My Father, if it is possible let
this cup pass from me; but not as I will, but as thou wilt.
<sup class="v">26:40</sup>And he came to the disciples and found
them sleeping, and said to Peter, Are you so unable to watch with
me one hour? <sup class="v">26:41</sup>Watch and pray that you
enter not into trial; the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh
is weak.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">26:42</sup>Going away again a
second time, he prayed, saying, My Father, if this cup cannot pass
from me unless I drink it, thy will be done. <sup class=
"v">26:43</sup>And he came and found them sleeping again, for their
eyes were heavy. <sup class="v">26:44</sup>And leaving them, again
he went away and prayed, saying the same words. <sup class=
"v">26:45</sup>Then he came to the disciples and said to them, Do
you sleep still and take your rest? Behold the hour is at hand, and
the Son of man is delivered into the hands of sinners. <sup class=
"v">26:46</sup>Arise, let us go; behold, he that betrays me is at
hand.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">26:47</sup>And while he was yet
speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a
great multitude, with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and
elders of the people. <sup class="v">26:48</sup>And he that
betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, The one that I shall kiss is
he; take him. <sup class="v">26:49</sup>And immediately coming
forward to Jesus, he said, Hail, Rabbi, and kissed him. <sup class=
"v">26:50</sup>But Jesus said to him, Comrade, for what have you
come? Then they came forward, and laid hands on Jesus, and took
him. <sup class="v">26:51</sup>And behold, one of those with Jesus,
stretching out his hand, drew his sword, and striking the servant
of the chief priest cut off his ear. <sup class="v">26:52</sup>Then
Jesus said to him, Put up your sword in its place; for all who take
the sword shall perish by the sword. <sup class="v">26:53</sup>Do
you think that I could not ask my Father, and he would furnish me
more than twelve legions of angels? <sup class="v">26:54</sup>How
then would the Scriptures be accomplished, that it must be so?</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">26:55</sup>At that time Jesus
said to the multitudes, Have you come out as against a robber, with
swords and clubs to take me? I sat daily teaching in the temple,
and you did not take me; <sup class="v">26:56</sup>but all this was
done that the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then the
disciples all forsook him and fled. <sup class="v">26:57</sup>And
having taken Jesus, they led him away to Caiaphas, the chief
priest, where the scribes and elders were assembled. <sup class=
"v">26:58</sup>But Peter followed him at a distance, even to the
court of the chief priest, and going in sat with the officers to
see the end.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">26:59</sup>And the chief priests
and all the sanhedrim sought false testimony against Jesus to kill
him, <sup class="v">26:60</sup>and did not find it, though many
false witnesses came forward. But afterwards, two coming forward
<sup class="v">26:61</sup>said, This man said, I can destroy the
temple of God and build it in three days. <sup class=
"v">26:62</sup>And the chief priest rising up said to him, Do you
answer nothing? What do these testify against you? <sup class=
"v">26:63</sup>But Jesus was silent. And the chief priest
answering, said to him, I adjure you, by the living God, to tell me
if you are the Christ, the Son of God. <sup class=
"v">26:64</sup>Jesus said to him, As you say; but I tell you that
hereafter you shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of
the power, and coming on the clouds of heaven.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">26:65</sup>Then the chief priest
rent his clothes, saying, He has blasphemed; what further need have
we of witnesses? Behold, now you have heard the blasphemy.
<sup class="v">26:66</sup>What do you think? And they answered and
said, He is worthy of death. <sup class="v">26:67</sup>Then they
spit in his face, and struck him with their fists, and some struck
him with the palms of their hands, <sup class=
"v">26:68</sup>saying, Prophesy to us, Christ, who is it that
struck you?</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">26:69</sup>But Peter sat without
in the court; and a female servant came to him, saying, You also
were with Jesus the Galilean. <sup class="v">26:70</sup>But he
denied it before all, saying, I know not what you say. <sup class=
"v">26:71</sup>And going out into the porch, another [female
servant] saw him, and said to those there, This man was also with
Jesus the Nazoraean. <sup class="v">26:72</sup>And again he denied
with an oath, saying, I know not the man. <sup class=
"v">26:73</sup>But after a little while those standing by came
forward, and said to Peter, Certainly you are also one of them, for
your speech makes you manifest. <sup class="v">26:74</sup>Then he
began to curse and swear, saying, I know not the man. And
immediately a cock crew; <sup class="v">26:75</sup>and Peter
remembered the word of Jesus, who said, Before a cock crows you
will deny me thrice; and he went out and wept bitterly.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST BEFORE PONTIUS PILATE.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">27:1</sup>AND when it was morning
all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel
against Jesus to kill him. <sup class="v">27:2</sup>And having
bound him, they led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate,
the procurator. <sup class="v">27:3</sup>Then Judas, who betrayed
him, seeing that he was condemned, repenting, returned the thirty
shekels of silver [$16.80] to the chief priests and elders,
<sup class="v">27:4</sup>saying, I have sinned, betraying innocent
blood. But they said, What is that to us? see you to it.
<sup class="v">27:5</sup>And throwing down the silver in the temple
he departed; and having gone away strangled himself.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">27:6</sup>And the chief priests
taking the silver said, It is not lawful to put it into the
treasury, because it is the price of blood. <sup class=
"v">27:7</sup>And taking counsel, they bought with it the potter's
field for a burying place for strangers. <sup class=
"v">27:8</sup>For this reason, the field is called a field of blood
to this day. <sup class="v">27:9</sup>Then was fulfilled the word
spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying; And they took the thirty
shekels of silver, the price of him that was prized, whom [men]
from the sons of Israel set a price upon, <sup class=
"v">27:10</sup>and gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord
commanded me.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">27:11</sup>And Jesus stood before
the procurator; and the procurator asked him, saying, Are you the
king of the Jews? And Jesus said to him, As you say. <sup class=
"v">27:12</sup>And when he was accused by the chief priests and
elders he answered nothing. <sup class="v">27:13</sup>Then Pilate
said to him, Do you not hear how many things they testify against
you? <sup class="v">27:14</sup>And he answered him not a word; so
that the procurator wondered greatly.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">27:15</sup>And at the feast the
procurator was accustomed to release to the multitude one prisoner,
whom they chose; <sup class="v">27:16</sup>and he then had a noted
prisoner called Barabbas. <sup class="v">27:17</sup>When,
therefore, they were assembled together, Pilate said to them, Which
do you wish me to release to you? Barabbas? or Jesus, called
Christ? <sup class="v">27:18</sup>For he knew that they had
delivered him up from envy. <sup class="v">27:19</sup>And as he sat
on the tribunal his wife sent to him, saying, Have nothing to do
with that just man, for I have suffered much to-day on his account,
from a dream.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">27:20</sup>But the chief priests
and elders persuaded the people to ask for Barabbas, and to destroy
Jesus. <sup class="v">27:21</sup>And the procurator answered and
said to them, Which of the two do you wish me to release to you?
And they said, Barabbas. <sup class="v">27:22</sup>Pilate said to
them, What then shall I do to Jesus, called Christ? They all said,
Let him be crucified. <sup class="v">27:23</sup>But he said, [No];
for what evil has he done? And they cried more vehemently, saying,
Let him be crucified.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">27:24</sup>And Pilate seeing that
he accomplished nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, took
water and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am
innocent of the blood of this man; see you to it. <sup class=
"v">27:25</sup>And all the people answered and said, His blood be
upon us and upon our children. <sup class="v">27:26</sup>Then he
released Barabbas to them, and having scourged Jesus delivered him
up to be crucified.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST'S DEATH AND BURIAL.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">27:27</sup>THEN the soldiers of
the procurator taking Jesus to the Pr&aelig;torium assembled about
him the whole cohort, <sup class="v">27:28</sup>and stripped him,
and put on him a crimson cloak, <sup class="v">27:29</sup>and
making a crown of thorns they put it on his head, and a reed in his
right hand; and they knelt before him, and mocked him, saying,
Hail, King of the Jews! <sup class="v">27:30</sup>And they spit on
him, and took the reed and beat him on his head. <sup class=
"v">27:31</sup>And when they had mocked him, they took the cloak
off from him, and put on him his own clothes, and led him away to
crucify him.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">27:32</sup>And going out, they
found a Cyrenian by the name of Simon, whom they compelled to bear
his cross. <sup class="v">27:33</sup>And coming to a place called
Golgotha, which is called A place of a cranium, <sup class=
"v">27:34</sup>they gave him vinegar to drink mixed with gall; and
when he had tasted of it he would not drink.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">27:35</sup>And having crucified
him, they parted his garments, casting lots, <sup class=
"v">27:36</sup>and sat down and watched him there. <sup class=
"v">27:37</sup>And they put over his head his accusation, written;
THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS. <sup class="v">27:38</sup>Then
two robbers were crucified with him, one on the right hand, and the
other on the left.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">27:39</sup>And those who went by
blasphemed him, wagging their heads, <sup class="v">27:40</sup>and
saying, You that destroy the temple and build it in three days,
save yourself. If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross.
<sup class="v">27:41</sup>And the chief priests in like manner also
mocked him, with the scribes and elders, and said, <sup class=
"v">27:42</sup>He saved others, himself he cannot save. If he is
the king of Israel let him come down now from the cross, and we
will believe on him; <sup class="v">27:43</sup>he trusted in God;
let him deliver him if he wishes for him; for he said, I am a Son
of God. <sup class="v">27:44</sup>The robbers also that were
crucified with him did the same, and reproached him. <sup class=
"v">27:45</sup>And from the sixth hour there was darkness on all
the land till the ninth hour; <sup class="v">27:46</sup>and at
about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli,
Eli, lama sabachthani? that is, My God, my God, why hast thou
forsaken me? <sup class="v">27:47</sup>And some of those standing
there hearing him, said, He calls for Elijah. <sup class=
"v">27:48</sup>And one of them ran immediately to him, and took a
sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and putting it on a reed gave
it to him to drink. <sup class="v">27:49</sup>But the rest said,
Let him alone; let us see if Elijah will come and save him.
<sup class="v">27:50</sup>And Jesus crying again with a loud voice,
gave up the spirit.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">27:51</sup>And behold, the vail
of the temple was rent in two, from top to bottom, and the earth
was shaken, and the rocks rent, <sup class="v">27:52</sup>and the
tombs were opened, and many bodies of saints that slept arose,
<sup class="v">27:53</sup>and going out of the tombs, after his
resurrection entered into the holy city, and appeared to many.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">27:54</sup>And the centurion and
those with him watching Jesus, seeing the earthquake, and the
[other] events which occurred, were greatly afraid, and said,
Certainly, this was a Son of God. <sup class="v">27:55</sup>And
there were many women there, beholding from afar, who had followed
Jesus from Galilee, to wait upon him; <sup class=
"v">27:56</sup>among whom were Mary the Magdalene, and Mary the
mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of
Zebedee.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">27:57</sup>And when it was
evening a rich man came from Arimathea, by the name of Joseph, who
himself also was a disciple of Jesus; <sup class=
"v">27:58</sup>this man went to Pilate and asked for the body of
Jesus. Then Pilate commanded it to be given him; <sup class=
"v">27:59</sup>and Joseph took the body, and wrapped it in clean
linen, <sup class="v">27:60</sup>and placed it in a new tomb of his
which he had excavated in a rock, and having rolled a great stone
to the door of the tomb he went away; <sup class="v">27:61</sup>and
Mary the Magdalene and the other Mary were there, sitting opposite
to the tomb.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST AFTER HIS RESURRECTION.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">27:62</sup>AND on the next day,
which is after the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees
were assembled together to Pilate, <sup class="v">27:63</sup>and
said, Sir, we remember that this deceiver said when he was yet
alive, After three days I will rise. <sup class=
"v">27:64</sup>Command, therefore, the tomb to be made safe till
the third day, lest his disciples should come and steal him, and
say to the people, He is raised from the dead, and the last error
be worse than the first. <sup class="v">27:65</sup>Pilate said to
them, You have a guard; go and make it as safe as you can.
<sup class="v">27:66</sup>And they went and made the tomb safe with
a guard, having sealed the stone.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">28:1</sup>And after the sabbath,
when it began to dawn on the first day of the week, came Mary the
Magdalene, and the other Mary, to see the tomb. <sup class=
"v">28:2</sup>And behold, there was a great earthquake, for an
angel of the Lord descending from heaven came and rolled away the
stone and sat upon it. <sup class="v">28:3</sup>And his appearance
was like lightning, and his clothing as white as snow; <sup class=
"v">28:4</sup>and from fear of him the keepers shook and became
like dead men. <sup class="v">28:5</sup>And the angel answered and
said to the women, Fear not, for I know that you seek Jesus the
crucified. <sup class="v">28:6</sup>He is not here, for he is
raised, as he said. Come and see the place where the Lord lay,
<sup class="v">28:7</sup>and go immediately and tell his disciples
that he is raised from the dead; and behold, he will go before you
into Galilee; there shall you see him. Behold, I have told you.
<sup class="v">28:8</sup>And going out immediately from the tomb
with fear and great joy, they ran to tell his disciples.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">28:9</sup>And behold, Jesus also
met them, saying, Hail! And they approached him, and took hold of
his feet, and worshipped him. <sup class="v">28:10</sup>Then Jesus
said to them, Fear not; go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee,
and there they shall see me. <sup class="v">28:11</sup>And as they
went, behold, some of the guard came into the city and told the
chief priests all the things which had happened. <sup class=
"v">28:12</sup>And being assembled with the elders, and taking
counsel, they gave large sums of money to the soldiers, <sup class=
"v">28:13</sup>saying, Say that his disciples came by night and
stole him while we slept; <sup class="v">28:14</sup>and if this is
heard of by the procurator we will satisfy him and secure you.
<sup class="v">28:15</sup>And they took the silver and did as they
were told; and this report is circulated among the Jews to this
day.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">28:16</sup>And the eleven
disciples went to Galilee on the mountain where Jesus had appointed
them; <sup class="v">28:17</sup>and they saw and worshipped him;
but some doubted. <sup class="v">28:18</sup>And Jesus coming near
spoke to them, saying, All power is given me in heaven and on the
earth; <sup class="v">28:19</sup>go and disciple all nations,
baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of
the Holy Spirit; <sup class="v">28:20</sup>teaching them to keep
all things which I have commanded you; and behold, I am with you
always till the consummation of the world.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>
<h3>THE MINISTRY OF JOHN THE BAPTIST, THE BAPTISM OF CHRIST, HIS
TEMPTATIONS, AND THE COMMENCEMENT OF HIS MINISTRY.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">1:1</sup>THE beginning of the
good news of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, <sup class=
"v">1:2</sup>as it is written in Isaiah the prophet; Behold, I send
my messenger before your face, who shall prepare your way.
<sup class="v">1:3</sup>A voice of one crying in the wilderness,
Prepare the way of the Lord! Make his paths straight.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">1:4</sup>John baptized in the
wilderness, preaching the baptism of a change of mind for the
forgiveness of sins. <sup class="v">1:5</sup>And all the country of
Judea and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him and were
baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">1:6</sup>And John was clothed
with camel's hairs and a leather girdle about his loins, and he eat
locusts and wild honey, <sup class="v">1:7</sup>and preached,
saying, After me comes one mightier than I, the strings of whose
shoes I am not fit to stoop down and untie; <sup class=
"v">1:8</sup>I have baptized you with water, but he shall baptize
you with the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">1:9</sup>In those days came Jesus
from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized in the Jordan by John;
<sup class="v">1:10</sup>and going up immediately out of the water,
he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit descend like a dove upon
him; <sup class="v">1:11</sup>and there was a voice from heaven,
You are my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased. <sup class=
"v">1:12</sup>And the Spirit immediately drove him into the
wilderness, <sup class="v">1:13</sup>and he was in the wilderness
forty days, tempted by Satan, and was with the beasts; and the
angels waited on him.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">1:14</sup>And after John was
delivered up Jesus came into Galilee preaching the good news of
God, <sup class="v">1:15</sup>saying, The time is completed, and
the kingdom of God is at hand; change your minds and believe in the
good news. <sup class="v">1:16</sup>And passing along by the lake
of Galilee, he saw Simon, and Andrew, Simon's brother, casting [a
net] into the lake, for they were fishermen. <sup class=
"v">1:17</sup>And Jesus said to them, Come after me, and I will
make you fishermen of men. <sup class="v">1:18</sup>And immediately
leaving their nets they followed him. <sup class="v">1:19</sup>And
proceeding a little further on he saw James the son of Zebedee, and
John his brother; and they were in the ship mending the nets;
<sup class="v">1:20</sup>and he immediately called them. And
leaving their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired men, they
went away after him.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">1:21</sup>And they entered into
Capernaum, and immediately on the sabbath he taught in the
synagogues. <sup class="v">1:22</sup>And they were astonished at
his teaching, for he taught them as having authority, and not as
the scribes.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">1:23</sup>And immediately there
was in their synagogue a man with an impure spirit, and he cried
out, <sup class="v">1:24</sup>saying, What have you to do with us,
Jesus Nazarene? have you come to destroy us? We know you who you
are, the holy [Son] of God! <sup class="v">1:25</sup>And Jesus
rebuked him saying, Be still, and come out of him. <sup class=
"v">1:26</sup>And the impure spirit affecting him with convulsions,
and crying with a loud voice, came out of him. <sup class=
"v">1:27</sup>And all were astonished, so that they inquired among
themselves, saying, What is this? a new teaching with authority,
and does he command the impure spirits and they obey him?
<sup class="v">1:28</sup>And his fame went out immediately into all
the country about Galilee.</p>
<p class="pin">8 <sup class="v">1:29</sup>And going immediately
out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew
with James and John; <sup class="v">1:30</sup>and Simon's
mother-in-law was lying with a fever; and immediately they told him
of her. <sup class="v">1:31</sup>And coming, he took her by the
hand, and raised her up, and the fever immediately left her, and
she waited on them.</p>
<p class="pin">9 <sup class="v">1:32</sup>And at evening when the
sun went down they brought to him all that were sick, and the
demoniacs; <sup class="v">1:33</sup>and the whole city was
assembled at the door. <sup class="v">1:34</sup>And he healed many
that were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons, and
suffered not the demons to say that they knew him.</p>
<p class="pin">10 <sup class="v">1:35</sup>And in the morning
while it was quite dark he arose and went out, and departed to a
solitary place, and there prayed. <sup class="v">1:36</sup>And
Simon and those with him followed him, <sup class="v">1:37</sup>and
said to him, All men seek you. <sup class="v">1:38</sup>And he said
to them, Let us go elsewhere to the adjoining villages to preach
there; because for this purpose have I come. <sup class=
"v">1:39</sup>And he preached in their synagogues in all Galilee,
and cast out demons.</p>
<p class="pin">11 <sup class="v">1:40</sup>And a leper came to
him beseeching him, saying to him, If you will, you can cleanse me.
<sup class="v">1:41</sup>And having compassion on him, he stretched
out his hand and touched him, and said to him, I will; be cleansed.
<sup class="v">1:42</sup>And the leprosy immediately left him, and
he was cleansed. <sup class="v">1:43</sup>And giving him a strict
charge, he immediately sent him away, <sup class="v">1:44</sup>and
said to him, See that you say nothing to any one, but go and show
yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing what Moses
commanded, for a testimony to them. <sup class="v">1:45</sup>And
going out he spread and published abroad the report, to such an
extent that he [Jesus] could no longer go openly into a city, but
was without in solitary places; and they came to him from every
quarter.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST FORGIVING SINS, EATING WITH PUBLICANS AND SINNERS, AND
HIS DOCTRINE OF FASTING, OF THE SABBATH, ETC.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">2:1</sup>AND entering again into
Capernaum after some days, it was reported that he was in the
house. <sup class="v">2:2</sup>And many came together immediately,
so that there was no room, not even in the places about the door;
and he spoke to them the word. <sup class="v">2:3</sup>And they
came to him bringing a paralytic, borne by four; <sup class=
"v">2:4</sup>and not being able to approach him on account of the
multitude, they uncovered the roof where he was, and having made an
opening let down the bed on which the paralytic was laid.
<sup class="v">2:5</sup>And Jesus seeing their faith, said to the
paralytic, Son, your sins are forgiven.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">2:6</sup>And some of the scribes
were sitting there, and reasoned in their minds, <sup class=
"v">2:7</sup>Why does this man speak so? he blasphemes. Who can
forgive sins but God alone? <sup class="v">2:8</sup>And Jesus
immediately knowing in his spirit that they so reasoned within
themselves, said to them, Why do you reason in your minds?
<sup class="v">2:9</sup>in what respect is it easier to say to the
paralytic, Your sins are forgiven you, than to say, Arise, take up
your bed and walk? <sup class="v">2:10</sup>But that you may know
that the Son of man has power to forgive sins on the earth, he said
to the paralytic, <sup class="v">2:11</sup>I tell you, arise, take
your bed and go to your house. <sup class="v">2:12</sup>And he was
raised up and immediately taking his bed he went away before all;
so that all were astonished, and glorified God, saying, We never
saw the like.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">2:13</sup>And he went out again
by the lake, and all the multitude came to him, and he taught them.
<sup class="v">2:14</sup>And passing by he saw Levi, the son of
Alpheus, sitting at the custom house, and said to him, Follow me;
and he arose and followed him. <sup class="v">2:15</sup>And he was
reclining in his house, and many publicans and sinners also
reclined with Jesus and his disciples, for many also followed him.
<sup class="v">2:16</sup>And the scribes and Pharisees seeing him
eating with sinners and publicans, said to his disciples, Why does
he eat and drink with sinners and publicans? <sup class=
"v">2:17</sup>And Jesus hearing it, said to them, The well need not
a physician, but the ill; I came not to call the righteous, but
sinners.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">2:18</sup>And the disciples of
John and of the Pharisees fasted. And they came and said to him,
Why do the disciples of John and the disciples of the Pharisees
fast, and your disciples fast not? <sup class="v">2:19</sup>And
Jesus said to them, Can the sons of the bridechamber fast as long
as the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom
with them, they cannot fast, <sup class="v">2:20</sup>but days will
come when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then they
shall fast at that time. <sup class="v">2:21</sup>No one sews a
piece of undressed cloth on an old garment; if he does the new
piece takes away its fullness from the old, and the rent is made
worse. <sup class="v">2:22</sup>And no one puts new wine into old
bottles; if he does the wine breaks the bottles, and the wine and
the bottles are destroyed.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">2:23</sup>And he was passing on
the sabbath through the grain fields, and his disciples began to
make their way, picking heads of grain. <sup class=
"v">2:24</sup>And the Pharisees said to him, See what they do on
the sabbath, which it is not lawful to do. <sup class=
"v">2:25</sup>And he said to them, Have you never read what David
did, when he had need, and was hungry? both he and those with him?
<sup class="v">2:26</sup>How he entered into the house of God under
Abiathar the chief priest, and eat the show bread, which it was not
lawful to eat, except for the priests, and gave also to them that
were with him? <sup class="v">2:27</sup>And he said to them, The
sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath; <sup class=
"v">2:28</sup>so that the Son of man is Lord even of the
sabbath.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">3:1</sup>And he entered again
into the synagogue, and there was a man there having a withered
hand. <sup class="v">3:2</sup>And they watched him [to see] if he
would cure him on the sabbath, that they might accuse him.
<sup class="v">3:3</sup>And he said to the man having the withered
hand, Arise in the midst. <sup class="v">3:4</sup>And he said to
them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath, or to do evil? to
save life, or to kill? And they were silent. <sup class=
"v">3:5</sup>And looking around on them in anger, being grieved at
the hardness of their hearts, he said to the man, Stretch out your
hand. And he stretched it out, and his hand was restored.
<sup class="v">3:6</sup>And the Pharisees went out immediately with
the Herodians, and took counsel against him to kill him.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">3:7</sup>And Jesus went away with
his disciples to the lake; and a great multitude followed him from
Galilee, <sup class="v">3:8</sup>and from Jerusalem, and from
Judea, and from Idumea, and beyond the Jordan. And those about Tyre
and Sidon, a great multitude, hearing what he did, came to him.
<sup class="v">3:9</sup>And he told his disciples to have a boat
constantly attend him on account of the multitude, that they might
not throng him. <sup class="v">3:10</sup>For he cured many, so that
all who had diseases fell down before him, that they might touch
him; <sup class="v">3:11</sup>and the impure spirits when they saw
him fell down before him, and cried, saying, You are the Son of
God. <sup class="v">3:12</sup>And he strictly charged them not to
make him known.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST CALLING THE TWELVE APOSTLES, THE CHARACTER OF HIS
MIRACLES, ETC., AND HIS LOVE FOR HIS DISCIPLES.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">3:13</sup>AND he went up on the
mountain, and called whom he would; and they went to him.
<sup class="v">3:14</sup>And he appointed twelve, that they should
be with him, and that he might send them out to preach, <sup class=
"v">3:15</sup>and have power to cast out demons. <sup class=
"v">3:16</sup>And he gave to Simon the name of Peter. [He appointed
him], <sup class="v">3:17</sup>and James the son of Zebedee, and
John the brother of James&mdash;and he gave them the names of
Boanerges, which is, Sons of thunder&mdash; <sup class=
"v">3:18</sup>and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew,
and Thomas, and James the son of Alpheus, and Thaddeus, and Simon
the Zealot, <sup class="v">3:19</sup>and Judas Iscariot, who also
betrayed him. And they came into a house, <sup class=
"v">3:20</sup>and again a multitude came together, so that they
could not eat bread. <sup class="v">3:21</sup>And those with him
hearing of it, went out to take him; for they said, He is beside
himself.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">3:22</sup>And the scribes coming
down from Jerusalem said, He has Beelzebul, and casts out demons by
the ruler of demons. <sup class="v">3:23</sup>And calling them, he
said to them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan? <sup class=
"v">3:24</sup>And if a kingdom is divided against itself, that
kingdom cannot stand; <sup class="v">3:25</sup>and if a house is
divided against itself, that house cannot stand; <sup class=
"v">3:26</sup>and if Satan has risen up against himself, and is
divided, he cannot stand, but has an end. <sup class=
"v">3:27</sup>But no one can enter into the house of a strong man,
and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man, and
then he will plunder his house. <sup class="v">3:28</sup>I tell you
truly, That all sins and blasphemies with which they blaspheme
shall be forgiven the children of men; <sup class="v">3:29</sup>but
whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit shall never have
forgiveness, but is the subject of an eternal mistake; <sup class=
"v">3:30</sup>because they said, He has an impure spirit.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">3:31</sup>Then came his brothers
and his mother, and standing without, sent to him to call him.
<sup class="v">3:32</sup>And a multitude sat around him. And they
said to him, Behold your mother, and your brothers, and your
sisters seek you without. <sup class="v">3:33</sup>And he answered
them and said, Who is my mother, or my brothers? <sup class=
"v">3:34</sup>And looking round on those sitting about him, he
said, Behold my mother, and my brothers! <sup class=
"v">3:35</sup>Whoever shall do the will of God, this is my brother,
and sister, and mother.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST'S PARABLES BY THE LAKE, AND HIS STILLING A TEMPEST.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">4:1</sup>AND again he taught by
the lake; and a very great multitude came together to him, so that
entering into a ship he sat on the lake, and all the multitude were
by the lake on the land. <sup class="v">4:2</sup>And he taught them
many things in parables, and said to them, in his teaching,
<sup class="v">4:3</sup>Hear! behold a sower went out to sow;
<sup class="v">4:4</sup>and in sowing, some fell on the way, and
the birds came and devoured it. <sup class="v">4:5</sup>And some
fell on a rocky place, where it had not much earth, and it came up
immediately, because it had no depth of earth; <sup class=
"v">4:6</sup>and when the sun rose, it was scorched, and because it
had no root it was dried up. <sup class="v">4:7</sup>And some fell
among thorns; and the thorns came up and choked it, and it yielded
no fruit. <sup class="v">4:8</sup>And some fell on good ground, and
produced fruit, growing up and increasing, and bore one thirty, one
sixty, and one a hundred. <sup class="v">4:9</sup>And he said, He
that has ears, let him hear.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">4:10</sup>And when he was alone,
those about him, with the twelve, asked him the parable.
<sup class="v">4:11</sup>And he said to them, To you is given the
mystery of the kingdom of God, but to those without all things are
in parables; <sup class="v">4:12</sup>that seeing they may see, and
not perceive, and hearing they may hear, and not understand, lest
at any time they should turn, and be forgiven. <sup class=
"v">4:13</sup>And he said to them, Do you not know this parable?
How then will you know all parables?</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">4:14</sup>The sower sows the
word. <sup class="v">4:15</sup>And these are those where the word
is sown by the way; and when they hear, Satan comes immediately and
takes away the word which was sown upon them. <sup class=
"v">4:16</sup>And these in like manner are those sown on the rocky
places; when they hear the word, they immediately receive it with
joy, <sup class="v">4:17</sup>and have no root in themselves, but
are temporary [disciples]. Then, when affliction or persecution
occurs on account of the word, they are immediately offended.
<sup class="v">4:18</sup>And those sown among thorns are different.
They are those who hear the word, <sup class="v">4:19</sup>and the
cares of life, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the desires of
other things coming in, choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.
<sup class="v">4:20</sup>And these are those sown in good ground,
who hear the word, and receive it, and bear fruit, one thirty, and
one sixty, and one a hundred.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">4:21</sup>And he said to them,
Does a light come to be put under a modius [1.916 gallon measure],
or under a bed? and not to be put in a candlestick? <sup class=
"v">4:22</sup>For there is nothing hid that shall not be made
manifest, nor any thing concealed that shall not come to light.
<sup class="v">4:23</sup>If any one has ears to hear, let him hear.
<sup class="v">4:24</sup>And he said to them, Consider what you
hear. With what measure you measure it shall be measured to you,
and more shall be given you. <sup class="v">4:25</sup>For whoever
has, to him shall be given; and whoever has not, from him even what
he has shall be taken away.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">4:26</sup>And he said, So is the
kingdom of God as a man casts the seeds into the earth, <sup class=
"v">4:27</sup>and sleeps and wakes, night and day, and the seed
germinates, and grows he knows not how. <sup class=
"v">4:28</sup>The earth produces spontaneously, first the stalk,
then the head, then the full wheat in the head. <sup class=
"v">4:29</sup>And when the wheat delivers itself, he immediately
sends out the sickle, because the harvest has come. <sup class=
"v">4:30</sup>And he said, To what shall I liken the kingdom of
God? or with what parable shall I present it? <sup class=
"v">4:31</sup>It is like a mustard seed, which when sown in the
earth is the least of all seeds on the earth; <sup class=
"v">4:32</sup>but when sown, it comes up, and becomes the greatest
of all plants, and produces great branches, so that the birds of
heaven can dwell under its shade. <sup class="v">4:33</sup>And with
many such parables spoke he the word to them as they could hear;
<sup class="v">4:34</sup>but without a parable spoke he not to
them; and, privately, he explained all things to his disciples.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">4:35</sup>And on that day, when
it was evening, he said to them, Let us cross over to the other
side. <sup class="v">4:36</sup>And dismissing the multitude, they
took him as he was in the ship; and other ships also were with him.
<sup class="v">4:37</sup>And there was a great tempest of wind, and
the waves beat over the ship, so that the ship was already filled.
<sup class="v">4:38</sup>And he was in the stern, on the pillow,
asleep. And they awoke him and said to him, Teacher, do you not
care that we perish? <sup class="v">4:39</sup>And he arose, and
rebuked the wind, and said to the lake, Hush! Be still! And the
wind ceased, and there was a great calm. <sup class=
"v">4:40</sup>And he said to them, Why are you so fearful? How have
you no faith? <sup class="v">4:41</sup>And they were greatly
afraid, and said one to another, What man is this, that even the
wind and the lake obey him?</p>
<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST CURING A DEMONIAC AND THE WOMAN WITH A HEMORRHAGE, AND
RAISING A DEAD CHILD.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">5:1</sup>AND they came across the
lake to the country of the Gerasenes. <sup class="v">5:2</sup>And
as he went out of the ship, a man with an impure spirit immediately
met him from the tombs, <sup class="v">5:3</sup>who lived in the
tombs, and none could bind him with a chain; <sup class=
"v">5:4</sup>for he was often bound with fetters and chains, and
his chains were broken by him, and his fetters crushed, and no one
could subdue him. <sup class="v">5:5</sup>And he was always night
and day in the tombs, and in the mountains, crying, and cutting
himself with stones. <sup class="v">5:6</sup>And seeing Jesus at a
distance, he ran and worshipped him, <sup class="v">5:7</sup>and
crying with a loud voice, said, What have you to do with me, Jesus,
son of the most high God? I adjure you, by God, not to torment me.
<sup class="v">5:8</sup>For he said to him, Impure spirit, come out
of the man. <sup class="v">5:9</sup>And he asked him, What is your
name? And he said to him, My name is Legion, for we are many.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">5:10</sup>And they besought him
much that he would not send them out of the country. <sup class=
"v">5:11</sup>And there was there on the mountain a great herd of
swine feeding. <sup class="v">5:12</sup>And they besought him,
saying, Send us to the swine, that we may go into them. <sup class=
"v">5:13</sup>And Jesus immediately permitted them. And the impure
spirits going out entered into the swine, and the herd rushed down
a precipice into the lake, about two thousand, and were drowned in
the lake.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">5:14</sup>And those who fed them
fled and told it in the city and in the country; and they came out
to see what was done. <sup class="v">5:15</sup>And they came to
Jesus, and saw the demoniac who had the legion, sitting down,
clothed, and in his right mind, and they were afraid. <sup class=
"v">5:16</sup>And those who saw related to them how it had been
with the demoniac, and concerning the swine. <sup class=
"v">5:17</sup>And they besought him to depart from their bounds.
<sup class="v">5:18</sup>And entering into the ship, the man that
had been a demoniac besought him that he might go with him;
<sup class="v">5:19</sup>and he permitted him not, but said to him,
Go to your home, to your friends, and relate to them what the Lord
has done for you, and what mercy he has shown you. <sup class=
"v">5:20</sup>And he went away and proclaimed in the Decapolis what
great things Jesus had done for him; and all wondered.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">5:21</sup>And Jesus having
crossed again in the ship to the other side, a great multitude came
together to him; and he was by the lake. <sup class=
"v">5:22</sup>And one of the synagogue rulers came, Jairus by name,
and seeing him, fell at his feet, <sup class="v">5:23</sup>and
besought him much, saying, My little daughter is at the point of
death; come and lay hands on her, that she may be restored, and she
shall live. <sup class="v">5:24</sup>And he went away with him; and
a great multitude followed him, and thronged him. <sup class=
"v">5:25</sup>And a certain woman having a hemorrhage of twelve
years, <sup class="v">5:26</sup>and having taken many things by
many physicians, and expended all her property, and not being
benefited, but rather growing worse, <sup class=
"v">5:27</sup>hearing of Jesus, came in the crowd behind him and
touched his clothes. <sup class="v">5:28</sup>For she said, If I
can touch his clothes I shall be cured.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">5:29</sup>And immediately the
fountain of her blood was dried up, and she knew in herself that
she was cured of the plague. <sup class="v">5:30</sup>And Jesus
immediately knowing in himself that a power had gone out from him,
turning round in the crowd said, Who touched my clothes?
<sup class="v">5:31</sup>And his disciples said to him, You see the
multitude throng you, and do you say, Who touched me? <sup class=
"v">5:32</sup>And he looked round to see her that had done this.
<sup class="v">5:33</sup>And the woman being afraid, and trembling,
knowing what was done to her, came and fell down before him, and
told him all the truth. <sup class="v">5:34</sup>And he said to
her, Daughter, your faith has cured you; go in peace, and be well
of your plague.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">5:35</sup>And while he was yet
speaking persons came from the house of the synagogue ruler,
saying, Your daughter is dead; why trouble the teacher? <sup class=
"v">5:36</sup>And Jesus hearing the word spoken, said to the
synagogue ruler, Fear not, only believe. <sup class=
"v">5:37</sup>And he permitted no man to accompany him except
Peter, and James, and John the brother of James. <sup class=
"v">5:38</sup>And they came to the house of the synagogue ruler,
and saw the tumult, and the people weeping and lamenting much.
<sup class="v">5:39</sup>And he went in and said to them, Why do
you make a tumult and weep? the little child is not dead, but
sleeps. <sup class="v">5:40</sup>And they derided him. And putting
them all out, he took the father and mother of the little child,
and those with him, and went in where the little child was;
<sup class="v">5:41</sup>and taking the hand of the little child,
he said to her, Talitha cum, which is interpreted, Girl, I tell you
arise; <sup class="v">5:42</sup>and immediately the girl arose and
walked about, for she was twelve years old. And they were
astonished with great astonishment. <sup class="v">5:43</sup>And he
charged them strictly that no one should know it, and directed that
food should be given her.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST AT NAZARETH, SENDING OUT HIS TWELVE APOSTLES TO PREACH,
THE DEATH OF JOHN THE BAPTIST, THE REPORT OF THE APOSTLES, FEEDING
FIVE THOUSAND, AND WALKING ON THE LAKE.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">6:1</sup>AND he departed thence,
and came into his own country. And his disciples followed him.
<sup class="v">6:2</sup>And when it was the sabbath, he taught in
the synagogue; and many heard him and were astonished, and said,
Whence has this man these things? and what is the wisdom given to
him? And [what are] these mighty works done by his hands?
<sup class="v">6:3</sup>Is not this the carpenter? the son of Mary?
and a brother of James, and Joset, and Judas, and Simon? And are
not his sisters here with us? And they were offended with him.
<sup class="v">6:4</sup>And Jesus said to them, A prophet is not
without honor, except in his own country, and with his relations,
and in his own house. <sup class="v">6:5</sup>And he could not do
any mighty work there, except that he laid hands on a few sick
persons, and cured them. <sup class="v">6:6</sup>And he wondered at
their unbelief. And he went about the villages in order,
teaching.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">6:7</sup>And he called the
twelve, and sent them out two and two, and gave them power over
impure spirits; <sup class="v">6:8</sup>and charged them to take
nothing for the way, except a staff only; not bread, nor a
provision sack, nor copper in the girdle, <sup class=
"v">6:9</sup>but to wear sandals, and not to put on two coats.
<sup class="v">6:10</sup>And he said to them, Where you enter into
a house, there remain till you go out thence. <sup class=
"v">6:11</sup>And whatever place will not receive you, nor hear
you, when you go out thence shake off the dust which is under your
feet for a testimony to them. <sup class="v">6:12</sup>And going
out, they preached that [men] should change their minds,
<sup class="v">6:13</sup>and cast out many demons, and anointed
many sick persons with oil, and cured them.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">6:14</sup>And Herod the king,
heard [of Jesus], for his name was widely known, and said, John the
Baptist has risen from the dead; and on this account the mighty
works are performed by him. <sup class="v">6:15</sup>But others
said, he is Elijah; and others said, He is a prophet, like one of
the prophets. <sup class="v">6:16</sup>But Herod hearing of him,
said, This is John whom I beheaded; he has been raised up.
<sup class="v">6:17</sup>For Herod had sent and taken John, and,
put him bound in prison on account of Herodias, his brother
Philip's wife, because he had married her. <sup class=
"v">6:18</sup>For John said to Herod, It is not lawful for you to
have your brother's wife. <sup class="v">6:19</sup>And Herodias was
displeased with him, and wished to kill him, but was not able.
<sup class="v">6:20</sup>For Herod feared John, knowing that he was
a righteous and holy man, and he preserved him, and hearing him,
did many things, and heard him gladly. <sup class="v">6:21</sup>And
on a convenient day, when Herod made a supper in honor of his
birthday, for his great men, and the chiliarchs, and the first men
of Galilee, <sup class="v">6:22</sup>the daughter of this Herodias
came in and danced, and pleased Herod, and those that reclined with
him. And the king said to the girl, Ask me what you will and I will
give it to you; <sup class="v">6:23</sup>and he swore to her,
Whatever you shall ask of me I will give you, to half of my
kingdom. <sup class="v">6:24</sup>And she went out and said to her
mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the
Baptist. <sup class="v">6:25</sup>And coming in immediately with
haste to the king, she asked, saying, I wish you to give me
immediately on a plate the head of John the Baptist.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">6:26</sup>And the king was
extremely sorry, but on account of the oaths, and those reclining
with him, he was not willing to refuse her. <sup class=
"v">6:27</sup>And the king immediately sending an executioner,
commanded him to bring his head. And he went out and beheaded him
in the prison, <sup class="v">6:28</sup>and brought his head on a
plate, and gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother.
<sup class="v">6:29</sup>And his disciples hearing of it, came and
took up his body, and laid it in a tomb.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">6:30</sup>And the apostles came
together to Jesus and reported to him all things, both what they
had done and what instructions they had given. <sup class=
"v">6:31</sup>And he said to them, Come to a solitary place by
yourselves, and rest a little; for many were coming and going, and
there was no convenient time to eat. <sup class="v">6:32</sup>And
they went away to a solitary place in the ship by themselves.
<sup class="v">6:33</sup>And many saw them going, and knew them;
and they ran together there from all the cities on foot, and went
before them. <sup class="v">6:34</sup>And going out he saw a great
multitude, and had compassion on them, for they were as sheep not
having a shepherd; and he taught them much.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">6:35</sup>And when much time had
already passed, his disciples came to him and said, This is a
solitary place, and much time has already passed; <sup class=
"v">6:36</sup>dismiss them, that they may go to the farms and
villages around, and buy them something to eat. <sup class=
"v">6:37</sup>And he answered and said to them, Give them something
to eat. And they said to him, Shall we go and buy two hundred
denarii [$28] worth of bread, and give them to eat? <sup class=
"v">6:38</sup>And he said to them, How many loaves have you? go and
see. And knowing, they said, Five, and two fishes. <sup class=
"v">6:39</sup>And he commanded them to cause all to recline in
companies on the green grass. <sup class="v">6:40</sup>And they sat
down in squares, by hundreds and by fifties. <sup class=
"v">6:41</sup>And taking the five loaves and two fishes, and
looking up to heaven, he blessed, and broke the loaves, and gave
them to his disciples to set before them. And he divided the two
fishes to all. <sup class="v">6:42</sup>And they all eat, and were
filled; <sup class="v">6:43</sup>and they took up of fragments
twelve traveling-baskets full, and of the fishes. <sup class=
"v">6:44</sup>And they that eat the bread were five thousand
men.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">6:45</sup>And he immediately
constrained his disciples to go into the ship, and to go before him
to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he dismissed the multitude;
<sup class="v">6:46</sup>and having dismissed them, he went away to
the mountain to pray. <sup class="v">6:47</sup>And when it was
evening, the ship was in the midst of the lake, and he alone on the
land. <sup class="v">6:48</sup>And seeing them troubled to proceed,
for the wind was against them, about the fourth watch of the night
he came to them walking on the lake, and wished to pass by them.
<sup class="v">6:49</sup>And seeing him walking on the lake, they
thought it was an apparition, and cried out, <sup class=
"v">6:50</sup>for they all saw and were troubled. And immediately
he spoke with them, and said to them, Be of good courage; it is I;
be not afraid. <sup class="v">6:51</sup>And he went up to them into
the ship, and the wind ceased, and they were astonished in
themselves above measure, and wondered; <sup class=
"v">6:52</sup>for they understood not concerning the bread, for
their heart was hardened.</p>
<p class="pin">8 <sup class="v">6:53</sup>And crossing over they
came to the land of Gennesaret, and came to anchor. <sup class=
"v">6:54</sup>And going out of the ship, they immediately knew him,
<sup class="v">6:55</sup>and ran about through that whole country,
and brought those that were sick on beds where they heard that he
was. <sup class="v">6:56</sup>And wherever he went, in villages, or
cities, or country places, they placed the sick in the markets, and
besought him that they might touch the fringe of his garment, and
as many as touched him were cured.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST'S DOCTRINE OF DEFILEMENT; CURING A GENTILE DEMONIAC, AND
A DEAF AND DUMB PERSON.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">7:1</sup>AND the Pharisees and
some of the scribes having come from Jerusalem came together to
him, <sup class="v">7:2</sup>and seeing some of his disciples eat
bread with defiled, that is, unwashed hands, [they found fault].
<sup class="v">7:3</sup>For the Pharisees and all the Jews eat not
unless they wash their hands with the fist, holding the tradition
of the elders. <sup class="v">7:4</sup>And from a market, unless
they baptize they eat not; and there are many other [customs] which
they have received to hold; baptisms, of cups and sextuses [1 1-2
pint measures], and brass vessels, and beds. <sup class=
"v">7:5</sup>And the Pharisees and scribes asked, Why do not your
disciples conform to the tradition of the elders; but eat bread
with defiled hands?</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">7:6</sup>And he said to them,
Well did Isaiah prophecy of you, hypocrites, as it is written; This
people honors me with the lips, but their heart is far from me;
<sup class="v">7:7</sup>but in vain do they worship me, teaching
for teachings the commandments of men; <sup class="v">7:8</sup>for
leaving the commandment of God, you hold the tradition of men.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">7:9</sup>And he said to them,
Well do you reject the commandment of God, to keep your tradition;
<sup class="v">7:10</sup>for Moses said, Honor your father and your
mother, and, He that reviles father or mother, let him surely die.
<sup class="v">7:11</sup>But you say, If a man says to his father
or mother, It is a corban, which is a gift, by whatever you might
be profited by me, [he shall be free]; <sup class="v">7:12</sup>and
suffer him no longer to do any thing for his father or his mother;
<sup class="v">7:13</sup>making the word of God of no effect by
your tradition which you have delivered; and many such things you
do. <sup class="v">7:14</sup>And again calling all the people, he
said to them, Hear me, all of you, and understand. <sup class=
"v">7:15</sup>Nothing which being out of a man entering into him,
can defile him; but those things which proceed from the man, these
are the things which defile the man.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">7:17</sup>And when he had gone
from the multitude into the house, his disciples asked him
concerning the parable. <sup class="v">7:18</sup>And he said to
them, Are you also so without understanding? Do you not understand
that nothing which enters into a man from without can defile him,
<sup class="v">7:19</sup>because it enters not into his heart, but
into the stomach, and goes out to the earth, purifying all
aliments? <sup class="v">7:20</sup>But he said, that which comes
out of the man, this defiles him; <sup class="v">7:21</sup>for from
within, from the hearts of men, proceed evil thoughts,
fornications, <sup class="v">7:22</sup>thefts, murders, adulteries,
covetousness, malice, deceit, lewdness, an evil eye, blasphemy,
pride, foolishness. <sup class="v">7:23</sup>All these evil things
proceed from within, and defile the man.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">7:24</sup>And he rose up, and
departed thence to the regions of Tyre. And entering into a house
he wished no one to know it; and he could not be hid. <sup class=
"v">7:25</sup>But immediately, a woman whose little daughter had an
impure spirit, hearing of him, came and fell down at his feet;
<sup class="v">7:26</sup>and she was a Greek, a Syrophenician by
race; and she asked him to cast the demon out of her daughter.
<sup class="v">7:27</sup>And he said to her, Suffer the children
first to be filled; it is not right to take the children's bread,
and cast it to the little dogs. <sup class="v">7:28</sup>And she
answered and said to him, Yes, Lord; for even the little dogs under
the table eat of the children's crumbs. <sup class=
"v">7:29</sup>And he said to her, For this speech, go; the demon
has gone out of your daughter. <sup class="v">7:30</sup>And
departing to her house, she found the little child laid on the bed,
and the demon gone out.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">7:31</sup>And again going out of
the bounds of Tyre, he came through Sidon, to the lake of Galilee,
in the midst of the bounds of Decapolis. <sup class=
"v">7:32</sup>And they brought him a dumb man that stammered, and
besought him to put his hand on him. <sup class="v">7:33</sup>And
taking him from the multitude by himself, he put his fingers in his
ears, and spit, and touched his tongue, <sup class=
"v">7:34</sup>and looking up to heaven he groaned, and said to him,
Ephphatha, which is, Be opened. <sup class="v">7:35</sup>And
immediately his ears were opened, and the cord of his tongue was
loosed, and he spoke correctly. <sup class="v">7:36</sup>And he
charged them to tell no one; but as much as he charged them, so
much the more they proclaimed [his works]. <sup class=
"v">7:37</sup>And they were astonished above measure, and said, He
has done all things well; he makes both the deaf to hear, and the
dumb to speak.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST FEEDING THE FOUR THOUSAND, REFUSING TO GIVE A SIGN FROM
HEAVEN, WARNING HIS DISCIPLES AGAINST THE PHARISEES, CURING A BLIND
MAN, CALLING FORTH PETER'S CONFESSION, AND PREDICTING HIS OWN
DEATH.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">8:1</sup>IN those days, again a
very great multitude being [around him], and not having any thing
to eat, calling his disciples, he said to them, <sup class=
"v">8:2</sup>I have compassion on the multitude, because already
they have continued with me three days, and have nothing to eat;
<sup class="v">8:3</sup>and if I send them fasting to their homes,
they will faint by the way, for some of them are from afar.
<sup class="v">8:4</sup>And his disciples answered him, Whence will
one be able to satisfy these with bread here in a wilderness?
<sup class="v">8:5</sup>And he asked them, How many loaves have
you? And they said, Seven. <sup class="v">8:6</sup>And he commanded
the multitude to sit down on the ground; and taking the seven
loaves, and giving thanks, he broke and gave them to his disciples
to set before them, and they set them before the people.
<sup class="v">8:7</sup>And they had a few small fishes; and having
blessed them, he commanded to present them also. <sup class=
"v">8:8</sup>And they eat and were filled; and they took up of the
fragments that remained over, seven store-baskets; <sup class=
"v">8:9</sup>and they were about four thousand. And he dismissed
them.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">8:10</sup>And entering
immediately into the ship, with his disciples, he came into the
parts of Dalmanutha. <sup class="v">8:11</sup>And the Pharisees
went out and questioned him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, to
try him. <sup class="v">8:12</sup>And groaning in his spirit, he
said, Why does this generation seek a sign? I tell you truly, there
shall no sign be given to this generation. <sup class=
"v">8:13</sup>And leaving them, he entered again into the ship, and
went away to the other side.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">8:14</sup>And they forgot to take
bread, and had but one loaf with them in the ship. <sup class=
"v">8:15</sup>And he charged them, saying, Observe and beware of
the leaven of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod.
<sup class="v">8:16</sup>And they reasoned with themselves, because
they had no bread. <sup class="v">8:17</sup>And Jesus knowing it,
said to them, Why do you reason because you have no bread? Do you
not yet perceive nor understand? Is your heart hardened?
<sup class="v">8:18</sup>Having eyes, do you not see? And having
ears, do you not hear? And do you not remember? <sup class=
"v">8:19</sup>When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand,
how many traveling baskets of fragments took you up? They said to
him, Twelve. <sup class="v">8:20</sup>And when I broke the seven
loaves for the four thousand, how many store-baskets of fragments
took you up? And they said, Seven. <sup class="v">8:21</sup>And he
said to them, Do you not yet understand?</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">8:22</sup>And they came to
Bethsaida; and they brought him a blind man, and besought him to
touch him. <sup class="v">8:23</sup>And taking the hand of the
blind man, he brought him out of the village, and spitting on his
eyes, and putting his hands on him, he asked him, Do you see any
thing? <sup class="v">8:24</sup>And looking up he said, I see men,
as trees walking. <sup class="v">8:25</sup>Then he put his hands on
his eyes again, and he looked, and was restored, and saw all things
clearly. <sup class="v">8:26</sup>And he sent him to his house,
saying, Go not into the village.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">8:27</sup>And Jesus went away,
and his disciples, to the villages of C&aelig;sarea Philippi; and
on the way he asked his disciples, saying to them, Who do men say
that I am? <sup class="v">8:28</sup>And they spoke to him, saying,
John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; and others still, One of the
prophets. <sup class="v">8:29</sup>And he asked them, And who say
you that I am? Peter answered and said to him, You are the Christ.
<sup class="v">8:30</sup>And he charged them to tell no one of him.
<sup class="v">8:31</sup>And he began to teach them that the Son of
man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, and the
chief priests, and the scribes; and be killed, and after three days
be raised again. <sup class="v">8:32</sup>And he spoke this word
plainly; and Peter taking hold of him, rebuked him. <sup class=
"v">8:33</sup>But turning round, and looking on his disciples, he
rebuked Peter, and said, Get behind me, Satan! for you regard not
the things of God, but the things of men.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">8:34</sup>And calling the
multitude, with his disciples, he said to them, Whoever wishes to
follow after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross and
follow me. <sup class="v">8:35</sup>For whoever wishes to save his
life, shall lose it; and whoever shall lose his life for my sake,
and that of the good news, shall save it. <sup class=
"v">8:36</sup>For what will it profit a man to gain the whole world
and lose his life? <sup class="v">8:37</sup>for what is the
exchange for his life? <sup class="v">8:38</sup>For whoever is
ashamed of me and of my words, in this adulterous and sinful
generation, of him will the Son of man also be ashamed, when he
comes in the glory of his Father, with the holy angels. <sup class=
"v">9:1</sup>And he said to them, I tell you truly, that there are
some of those standing here, who shall not taste death till they
see the kingdom of God having come with power.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST TRANSFIGURED, CURING A DEMONIAC, AGAIN PREDICTING HIS
DEATH, THE PRINCIPLES OF HIS KINGDOM.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">9:2</sup>AND after six days Jesus
took Peter, and James, and John, and brought them up on a high
mountain by themselves alone, and was transfigured before them;
<sup class="v">9:3</sup>and his garments became shining, extremely
white, so that no fuller on the earth could whiten them.
<sup class="v">9:4</sup>And Elijah appeared to them; with Moses,
and they conversed with Jesus. <sup class="v">9:5</sup>And Peter
answered and said to Jesus, Rabbi, it is good for us to be here;
and we will make three tabernacles, one for you, and one for Moses,
and one for Elijah; <sup class="v">9:6</sup>for he knew not what he
answered, for they were afraid. <sup class="v">9:7</sup>And a cloud
overshadowed them, and a voice came from the cloud, This is my
beloved Son; hear him. <sup class="v">9:8</sup>And looking round
immediately they no longer saw any one but Jesus alone with
them.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">9:9</sup>And coming down from the
mountain he charged them to tell no man what they had seen, till
the Son of man should have risen from the dead. <sup class=
"v">9:10</sup>And they kept the word, inquiring with themselves
what the rising from the dead meant. <sup class="v">9:11</sup>And
they asked him, saying, Why do the scribes say that Elijah must
first come? <sup class="v">9:12</sup>And he said to them, Elijah
comes first, and restores all things; as also it is written of the
Son of man, That he shall suffer many things, and be set at naught;
<sup class="v">9:13</sup>but I tell you, that Elijah has come, and
they have done to him what they wished, as it was written of
him.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">9:14</sup>And coming to the
disciples, he saw a great multitude about them, and the scribes
disputing with them. <sup class="v">9:15</sup>And immediately all
the multitude seeing him, were highly pleased, and ran forward and
saluted him. <sup class="v">9:16</sup>And he asked, What were you
disputing about with them? <sup class="v">9:17</sup>And one of the
multitude answered him, Teacher, I have brought my son to you,
having a dumb spirit; <sup class="v">9:18</sup>and wherever it
takes him it convulses him, and he foams and grates his teeth, and
becomes emaciated. And I spoke to your disciples to cast it out,
and they could not. <sup class="v">9:19</sup>And he answered and
said to them, O faithless and perverse generation! How long shall I
be with you? How long shall I suffer you? Bring him to me.
<sup class="v">9:20</sup>And they brought him to him. And seeing
him, the spirit immediately affected him with convulsions, and he
fell on the ground, and rolled about, foaming. <sup class=
"v">9:21</sup>And he asked his father, How long a time is it since
this came upon him? And he said, From a little child; <sup class=
"v">9:22</sup>and it often casts him into fire, and into waters, to
destroy him; but if you are able, help us, and have mercy on us.
<sup class="v">9:23</sup>And Jesus said to him, If you are able?
all things are possible to him that believes. <sup class=
"v">9:24</sup>And the father of the little child immediately crying
out, said, I believe; help my unbelief.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">9:25</sup>And Jesus seeing that a
multitude ran together, rebuked the impure spirit, saying to him,
Deaf and dumb spirit, I command you, come out of him, and enter
into him no more. <sup class="v">9:26</sup>And crying out and
affecting him with many convulsions, he went out. And he was like a
dead person, so that many said, He is dead. <sup class=
"v">9:27</sup>But Jesus took him by the hand and raised him up, and
he stood up. <sup class="v">9:28</sup>And when he went into the
house, his disciples asked him privately, Why could we not cast it
out? <sup class="v">9:29</sup>And he said to them, This kind can go
out by nothing but prayer.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">9:30</sup>And departing thence,
he passed through Galilee, and desired that no one should know him,
<sup class="v">9:31</sup>for he taught his disciples, and said to
them, The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men, and they
shall kill him. And when he is killed, on the third day he shall
rise again. <sup class="v">9:32</sup>And they understood not the
word, and were afraid to ask him.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">9:33</sup>And he came to
Capernaum; and when he was in the house, he asked them, What did
you dispute about on the way? <sup class="v">9:34</sup>And they
were silent; for they had disputed with each other on the way as to
who was the greatest. <sup class="v">9:35</sup>And he sat down and
called the twelve, and said to them, If any one wishes to be first,
he shall be last of all, and a servant of all. <sup class=
"v">9:36</sup>And taking a little child, he put it in the midst of
them, and taking it in his arms, said to them, <sup class=
"v">9:37</sup>Whoever receives one such little child in my name,
receives me, and whoever receives me, receives not me, but him that
sent me. <sup class="v">9:38</sup>And John spoke to him, saying,
Teacher, we saw some one casting out demons in your name, who
follows not us, and we forbade him. <sup class="v">9:39</sup>And
Jesus said, Forbid him not; for no one will perform a mighty work
in my name, and be able lightly to speak evil of me. <sup class=
"v">9:40</sup>For whoever is not against us is for us; <sup class=
"v">9:41</sup>and whoever gives you a cup of water because you are
Christ's, truly he shall not lose his reward.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">9:42</sup>And whoever shall
offend one of the little ones having faith, it would be better for
him if a millstone was put about his neck and he was cast into the
sea. <sup class="v">9:43</sup>And if your hand offends you, cut it
off; it is better for you to enter into life crippled, than having
two hands to go away into hell, into the inextinguishable fire.
<sup class="v">9:45</sup>And if your foot offends you, cut it off:
it is better for you to enter into life lame, than having two feet
to be cast into hell. <sup class="v">9:47</sup>And if your eye
offends you, pluck it out; it is better for you to enter into the
kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into
hell, <sup class="v">9:48</sup>where the worm dies not and the fire
is not extinguished. <sup class="v">9:49</sup>For every man shall
be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt.
<sup class="v">9:50</sup>Salt is good; but if the salt has become
insipid, with what will you season it? Have salt in yourselves, and
be at peace one with another.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST'S DOCTRINE OF MARRIAGE, CHILDREN AND THE WAY OF
SALVATION, HIS DEATH PREDICTED, AND SIGHT RESTORED TO
BARTIMEUS.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">10:1</sup>AND he arose and went
thence into the bounds of Judea, and beyond the Jordan; and again
multitudes came together to him, and again he taught them as he was
accustomed. <sup class="v">10:2</sup>And the Pharisees came and
asked him, to try him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife?
<sup class="v">10:3</sup>And he answered and said to them, What did
Moses command you? <sup class="v">10:4</sup>And they said, Moses
permitted us to write a bill of divorcement and put her away.
<sup class="v">10:5</sup>And Jesus said to them, Because of your
hardness of heart, he wrote you this ordinance; <sup class=
"v">10:6</sup>but from the beginning of creation, he made them male
and female. <sup class="v">10:7</sup>For this cause shall a man
leave his father and mother, and the two shall be one flesh;
<sup class="v">10:8</sup>so that they are no longer two, but one
flesh. <sup class="v">10:9</sup>What God therefore has yoked
together, let not man separate.</p>
<p class="pin"></p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">10:10</sup>And his disciples
asked him again, in the house, concerning this. <sup class=
"v">10:11</sup>And he said to them, Whoever puts away his wife and
marries another, commits adultery with her; <sup class=
"v">10:12</sup>and if a woman puts away her husband and marries
another, she commits adultery.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">10:13</sup>And they brought him
little children that he should touch them; and the disciples
rebuked those who brought them. <sup class="v">10:14</sup>But Jesus
seeing it, was displeased, and said to them, Suffer the little
children to come to me, and forbid them not; for of such is the
kingdom of God. <sup class="v">10:15</sup>I tell you truly, that
whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child,
shall not enter into it. <sup class="v">10:16</sup>And he took them
in his arms, and laid his hands on them, and blessed them.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">10:17</sup>And as he was going on
the way, one ran before and kneeled down to him, and asked him,
Good teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? <sup class=
"v">10:18</sup>And Jesus said to him, Why do you call me good? none
is good but one, God. <sup class="v">10:19</sup>You know the
commandments; You shall not commit adultery, You shall not kill,
You shall not steal, You shall not testify falsely, You shall not
defraud, Honor your father and mother. <sup class=
"v">10:20</sup>And he answered and said to him, Teacher, all these
have I kept from my youth. <sup class="v">10:21</sup>And Jesus
looking at him, loved him, and said to him, One thing you lack; go
and sell what you have, and give to the poor, and you shall have a
treasure in heaven; and come and take up your cross and follow me.
<sup class="v">10:22</sup>And he was grieved at this saying, and
went away sad, for he had great possessions.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">10:23</sup>And Jesus looking
around said to his disciples, With what difficulty shall those
having riches enter into the kingdom of God! <sup class=
"v">10:24</sup>And the disciples were astonished at his words. But
Jesus answered again and said to them, Children, with what
difficulty shall those who trust in riches enter into the kingdom
of God! <sup class="v">10:25</sup>It is easier for a camel to pass
through the eye of the needle, than for a rich man to enter into
the kingdom of God. <sup class="v">10:26</sup>And they were greatly
astonished, and said to themselves, Who then can be saved?
<sup class="v">10:27</sup>Jesus looking on them, said, With men it
is impossible, but not with God; for with God all things are
possible.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">10:28</sup>Peter said to him,
Behold we have left all things and followed you. <sup class=
"v">10:29</sup>Jesus said, I tell you truly, there is no one who
has left a house, or brothers, or sisters, or a mother, or father,
or children, or lands, for my sake, and for the sake of the good
news, <sup class="v">10:30</sup>who shall not receive a hundred
fold now at this present time, houses, and brethren, and sisters,
and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions, and in the
life to come eternal life. <sup class="v">10:31</sup>But many first
shall be last, and the last first.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">10:32</sup>And they were on the
way going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus went before them; and they
were amazed, and afraid, as they followed him. And again taking the
twelve aside, he told them the things that were about to befall
him; <sup class="v">10:33</sup>Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and
the Son of man will be delivered up to the chief priests and
scribes, and they will condemn him to death, and deliver him to the
gentiles, <sup class="v">10:34</sup>and they will mock him, and
spit on him, and scourge him, and kill him, and after three days he
shall rise again.</p>
<p class="pin">8 <sup class="v">10:35</sup>And James and John,
sons of Zebedee, came to him, saying, Teacher, we wish you to do
for us what we will ask of you. <sup class="v">10:36</sup>And he
said to them, What do you wish me to do for you? <sup class=
"v">10:37</sup>And they said to him, Grant us that we may sit one
on your right hand, and the other on your left, in your glory.
<sup class="v">10:38</sup>And Jesus said to them, You know not what
you ask. Can you drink of the cup of which I drink? or be baptized
with the baptism with which I am baptized? <sup class=
"v">10:39</sup>And they said to him, We can. And Jesus said to
them, You shall drink of the cup of which I drink, and be baptized
with the baptism with which I am baptized; <sup class=
"v">10:40</sup>but to sit on my right hand, or left, is not mine to
give but to those for whom it is prepared.</p>
<p class="pin">9 <sup class="v">10:41</sup>And the ten, hearing
this, were displeased with James and John. <sup class=
"v">10:42</sup>And Jesus called them and said to them, You know
that those who desire to rule the gentiles exercise lordship over
them, and their great men exercise authority over them; <sup class=
"v">10:43</sup>but it shall not be so with you. But whoever wishes
to be great among you, let him be your minister; <sup class=
"v">10:44</sup>and whoever wishes to be first of you, let him be a
servant of all. <sup class="v">10:45</sup>For the Son of man also
came not to be served, but to serve and to give his life a ransom
for many.</p>
<p class="pin">10 <sup class="v">10:46</sup>And they came to
Jericho. And as he went from Jericho, and his disciples and a great
multitude, the son of Timeus, Bartimeus, a blind beggar, sat by the
way. <sup class="v">10:47</sup>And hearing that Jesus was the
Nazarene, he cried, saying, Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me.
<sup class="v">10:48</sup>And many charged him to be still. But he
cried much more, Son of David, have mercy on me. <sup class=
"v">10:49</sup>And Jesus stopping, said, Call him. And they called
the blind man, saying to him, Be of good courage; arise, he calls
you. <sup class="v">10:50</sup>And he cast aside his garment, and
leaping up went to Jesus. <sup class="v">10:51</sup>And Jesus
answered him and said, What do you wish me to do for you? And the
blind man said to him, Rabboni, that I may receive my sight.
<sup class="v">10:52</sup>And Jesus said to him, Go; your faith has
cured you. And he immediately received sight, and followed him in
the way.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST ENTERING JERUSALEM IN TRIUMPH, CURSING THE BARREN FIG
TREE, PURIFYING THE TEMPLE, INCULCATING FAITH IN GOD, AND REPLYING
TO THE PHARISEES.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">11:1</sup>AND when they came near
to Jerusalem, at Bethphage and Bethany, at the Mount of Olives, he
sent two of his disciples, <sup class="v">11:2</sup>and said to
them, Go into the village opposite to you, and as you enter it you
will immediately find a colt tied, on which no man ever sat; untie
him and bring him. <sup class="v">11:3</sup>And if any one says to
you, Why do you do this? say, The Lord has need of him, and he will
immediately send him. <sup class="v">11:4</sup>And they went and
found a colt tied at the door without, at the crossing of the
streets, and they untied him. <sup class="v">11:5</sup>And some of
those standing there said to them, Why do you untie the colt?
<sup class="v">11:6</sup>And they said as Jesus directed, and they
let them go.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">11:7</sup>And they brought the
colt to Jesus, and put on it their clothes, and he sat on it.
<sup class="v">11:8</sup>And many spread their clothes in the way;
and others cutting branches from the trees spread them in the way;
<sup class="v">11:9</sup>and those who went before, and those who
followed, cried, Hosanna! Blessed is he that comes in the name of
the Lord! <sup class="v">11:10</sup>Blessed is the kingdom of our
father David, which is coming! Hosanna in the highest [heavens]!
<sup class="v">11:11</sup>And Jesus went into Jerusalem, and into
the temple, and looking round on all things when it was now evening
he went out to Bethany with the twelve.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">11:12</sup>And on the next day as
they returned from Bethany he was hungry; <sup class=
"v">11:13</sup>and seeing a fig tree at a distance having leaves,
he went to see if he could find any thing on it. And having come to
it, he found nothing except leaves, for it was not time for figs.
<sup class="v">11:14</sup>And he spoke and said to it, Let no one
eat fruit of you forever! And his disciples heard him.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">11:15</sup>And they came to
Jerusalem, and going into the temple he cast out those that sold
and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the brokers,
and the seats of those that sold doves, <sup class=
"v">11:16</sup>and permitted no one to carry a vessel through the
temple. <sup class="v">11:17</sup>And he taught them, saying, It is
written, my house shall be called a house of prayer for all
nations; but you have made it a den of robbers. <sup class=
"v">11:18</sup>And the scribes and chief priests came and sought
how they might destroy him, for they feared him, because all the
people were astonished at his teaching. <sup class=
"v">11:19</sup>And when it was evening he went out of the city.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">11:20</sup>And passing along in
the morning, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots.
<sup class="v">11:21</sup>And Peter remembering, said to him,
Rabbi, behold the fig tree which you cursed is dried up.
<sup class="v">11:22</sup>And Jesus answered and said to them, Have
faith in God; <sup class="v">11:23</sup>I tell you truly, that
whoever shall say to this mountain, be raised up and be cast into
the sea, and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that
what he says will be done, whatever he says shall be done for him.
<sup class="v">11:24</sup>Therefore I tell you, all things whatever
which you ask in prayer, believe that you shall receive them, and
you shall have them. <sup class="v">11:25</sup>And when you stand
praying, forgive if you have any thing against any, that your
Father in heaven may also forgive your offenses.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">11:27</sup>And they came again to
Jerusalem; and as he was walking in the temple, the chief priests,
and scribes, and elders came to him, <sup class="v">11:28</sup>and
said to him, By what authority do you do these things? or who gave
you this authority to do them? <sup class="v">11:29</sup>And Jesus
said to them, I will ask you one question; answer me, and I will
tell you by what authority I do these things. <sup class=
"v">11:30</sup>The baptism of John; was it from heaven, or of men?
answer me. <sup class="v">11:31</sup>And they reasoned with
themselves, saying, If we say from heaven, he will say, Why did you
not believe him? <sup class="v">11:32</sup>But if we say from men,
they feared the people, for all considered John as a prophet
indeed. <sup class="v">11:33</sup>And they answered and said to
Jesus, We do not know. And Jesus said to them, Neither do I tell
you by what authority I do these things.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">12:1</sup>And he said to them, in
parables, A man planted a vineyard and made a hedge about it, and
dug a wine-vat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen,
and went abroad. <sup class="v">12:2</sup>And he sent a servant to
the husbandmen at the time to receive from the husbandmen of the
fruits of the vineyard; <sup class="v">12:3</sup>and they took him,
and beat him, and sent him away empty. <sup class="v">12:4</sup>And
again he sent another servant to them, and they wounded him on the
head, and treated him shamefully. <sup class="v">12:5</sup>And he
sent another, and they killed him; and many others, and they beat
some, and killed some. <sup class="v">12:6</sup>Having yet one
beloved son, he sent him last to them, saying, They will reverence
my son.</p>
<p class="pin">8 <sup class="v">12:7</sup>But those husbandmen
said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and
the inheritance will be ours. <sup class="v">12:8</sup>And seizing
him, they killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard. <sup class=
"v">12:9</sup>What will the lord of the vineyard do? He will come
and destroy those husbandmen, and let the vineyard to others.
<sup class="v">12:10</sup>Have you not read this Scripture, The
stone which the builders rejected, has become the head of a corner;
<sup class="v">12:11</sup>this is from the Lord, and it is
wonderful in our eyes? <sup class="v">12:12</sup>And they sought to
take him, and feared the multitude, for they knew that he spoke
this parable against them. And they left him, and went away.</p>
<p class="pin">9 <sup class="v">12:13</sup>And they sent to him
some of the Pharisees and Herodians to ensnare him in his words.
<sup class="v">12:14</sup>And they came and said to him, Teacher,
we know that you are true, and care for no one, for you respect not
the face of men, but teach the way of God in truth. Is it lawful to
pay tribute to C&aelig;sar or not? <sup class="v">12:15</sup>Shall
we pay? or shall we not pay? But he knowing their hypocrisy, said
to them, Why do you try me? Bring me a denarius [14 cents], that I
may see it. <sup class="v">12:16</sup>And they brought him one. And
he said to them, Whose is this figure, and the inscription? And
they said to him, C&aelig;sar's. <sup class="v">12:17</sup>And
Jesus said, Render C&aelig;sar's dues to C&aelig;sar, and God's to
God. And they wondered at him.</p>
<p class="pin">10 <sup class="v">12:18</sup>And the Sadducees
came to him, who say there is no resurrection, and asked him,
saying, <sup class="v">12:19</sup>Teacher, Moses wrote to us, that
if one's brother dies and leaves a wife, and leaves no child, his
brother shall take his wife and raise up children for his brother.
<sup class="v">12:20</sup>There were seven brothers; and the first
took a wife and died, and left no child; <sup class=
"v">12:21</sup>and the second took her, and died leaving no child;
and the third in like manner. <sup class="v">12:22</sup>And the
seven left no child. Last of all, the woman died also. <sup class=
"v">12:23</sup>In the resurrection, when they rise, whose wife
shall she be? for the seven had her as a wife. <sup class=
"v">12:24</sup>Jesus said to them, Do you not err on this account,
not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God? <sup class=
"v">12:25</sup>For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry
nor are married, but are like angels in heaven. <sup class=
"v">12:26</sup>But concerning the dead, that they rise, have you
not read in the book of Moses, how God spoke to him at the bush,
saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God
of Jacob? <sup class="v">12:27</sup>He is not a God of the dead,
but of the living; you greatly err.</p>
<p class="pin">11 <sup class="v">12:28</sup>And one of the
scribes coming forward hearing them disputing, knowing that he
answered them well, asked him, What commandment is first of all?
<sup class="v">12:29</sup>Jesus answered, First is, Hear Israel,
the Lord our God is one Lord; <sup class="v">12:30</sup>and you
shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your
soul, and with all your strength. <sup class="v">12:31</sup>Second
is this, You shall love your neighbor as yourself. There is no
other commandment greater than these. <sup class="v">12:32</sup>And
the scribe said to him, Well, teacher, you have said truly; there
is one [God], and no other but him; <sup class="v">12:33</sup>and
to love him with all the heart, and all the understanding, and all
the strength, and to love one's neighbor as himself, is more than
all burnt offerings and sacrifices. <sup class="v">12:34</sup>And
Jesus seeing him, that he answered understandingly, said to him,
You are not far from the kingdom of God; and no one dared to
question him more.</p>
<p class="pin">12 <sup class="v">12:35</sup>And Jesus answered
and said, teaching in the temple, How do the scribes say that the
Christ is the Son of David? <sup class="v">12:36</sup>David himself
said, by the Holy Spirit, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit on my right
hand, till I make your enemies your footstool. <sup class=
"v">12:37</sup>David himself calls him Lord, and whence is he his
son? And the great multitude heard him gladly.</p>
<p class="pin">13 <sup class="v">12:38</sup>And he said to them
in his teaching, Beware of the scribes who desire to walk in long
robes, and desire salutations in the markets, <sup class=
"v">12:39</sup>and the first seats in the synagogues, and the first
places at feasts; <sup class="v">12:40</sup>who devour widows'
houses, and for a pretence make long prayers. They shall receive a
greater judgment.</p>
<p class="pin">14 <sup class="v">12:41</sup>And sitting opposite
to the treasury, he observed how the multitude cast copper into the
treasury. And many rich men cast in much; <sup class=
"v">12:42</sup>and one poor widow came and cast in two lepta, which
is a quadrans [4 mills]. <sup class="v">12:43</sup>And calling his
disciples, he said to them, I tell you truly, that this poor widow
has cast in more than all who have cast into the treasury.
<sup class="v">12:44</sup>For all [others] have cast in of their
abundance; but she of her want has cast in all that she had her
entire living.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST PREDICTING THE DESTRUCTION OF JERUSALEM, AND OF THE
JEWISH COMMONWEALTH.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">13:1</sup>AND as he went out of
the temple, one of his disciples said to him, Teacher, see what
stones, and what buildings! <sup class="v">13:2</sup>And Jesus said
to him, Do you see these great buildings? There shall not be left a
stone upon a stone, which shall not be thrown down. <sup class=
"v">13:3</sup>And as he sat on the mount of Olives, opposite to the
temple, Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, asked him
privately, <sup class="v">13:4</sup>Tell us when shall these things
be? And what shall be the sign when all these things are about to
be accomplished? <sup class="v">13:5</sup>And Jesus said to them,
See that no man deceives you; <sup class="v">13:6</sup>for many
shall come in my name, saying, I am [the Christ], and shall deceive
many. <sup class="v">13:7</sup>And when you hear of wars and rumors
of wars, be not afraid, for these things must be; but the end is
not yet. <sup class="v">13:8</sup>For nation shall rise against
nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there shall be earthquakes
in [different] places, and there shall be famines. These are the
beginnings of sorrows.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">13:9</sup>But take heed to
yourselves; they shall deliver you up to Sanhedrims, and you shall
be beaten in synagogues, and shall be brought before governors and
kings for my sake, for a testimony to them. <sup class=
"v">13:10</sup>And the good news must first be preached to all
nations. <sup class="v">13:11</sup>And when they deliver you to
afflictions, be not anxious beforehand what you shall say; but
whatever is given you in that hour, this speak; for it is not you
that speak, but the Holy Spirit. <sup class="v">13:12</sup>And
brother shall deliver brother to death, and father, son; and
children shall rise up against their parents and kill them;
<sup class="v">13:13</sup>and you shall be hated by all on my
account; but he that endures to the end shall be saved.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">13:14</sup>And when you see the
abomination of desolation standing where it ought not, let him that
reads understand, then let those in Judea flee to the mountains;
<sup class="v">13:15</sup>and let not him that is on the house go
down into the house, nor enter to take any thing out of his house;
<sup class="v">13:16</sup>and let not him that is in the field turn
back to take his garment. <sup class="v">13:17</sup>And woe to
those with child, and those giving nurse in those days! <sup class=
"v">13:18</sup>But pray that it may not be in the winter,
<sup class="v">13:19</sup>for those days shall be an affliction,
such as has not been from the beginning of the creation that God
created till now, and shall not be. <sup class="v">13:20</sup>And
unless the Lord had shortened those days no flesh would be saved;
but for the elects' sake, whom he has chosen, he has shortened the
days.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">13:21</sup>And then if any one
says to you, Behold the Christ is here! Behold there! believe it
not. <sup class="v">13:22</sup>For false prophets shall arise, and
perform miracles and wonders, to deceive, if possible, the elect.
<sup class="v">13:23</sup>But beware; I have foretold you all
things.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">13:24</sup>But in those days,
after that affliction, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon
shall not give her light, <sup class="v">13:25</sup>and the stars
shall fall from heaven, and the powers in the heavens shall be
shaken. <sup class="v">13:26</sup>And then shall they see the Son
of man coming in clouds, with great power and glory. <sup class=
"v">13:27</sup>And then shall he send his angels and gather
together the elect, from the four winds, from the end of the earth
to the end of heaven.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">13:28</sup>But learn the parable
of the fig tree. When its branch is now tender and it puts forth
leaves, it is known that the summer is nigh; <sup class=
"v">13:29</sup>so also when you see all these things occur, know
that [the Son of man] is nigh, at the doors. <sup class=
"v">13:30</sup>I tell you truly, that this generation shall not
pass away till all these things are accomplished. <sup class=
"v">13:31</sup>Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall
not pass away. <sup class="v">13:32</sup>But of that day, and hour,
knows no man, not an angel in heaven, nor the Son; but the Father.
<sup class="v">13:33</sup>Observe, watch, for you know not when the
time is.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">13:34</sup>As a man leaving his
house to go abroad, and giving authority to his servants, and to
each one his work, commanded the porter to watch, <sup class=
"v">13:35</sup>watch, therefore, for you know not when the master
of the house comes; at evening, at midnight, at the cock crowing,
or in the morning; <sup class="v">13:36</sup>lest, coming suddenly,
he should find you sleeping. <sup class="v">13:37</sup>And what I
say to you, I say to all, Watch.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST AT BETHANY, THE CONSPIRACY OF JUDAS, THE PASCHAL AND
LORD'S SUPPER, ETC.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">14:1</sup>AND after two days was
the passover and the unleavened bread. And the chief priests and
scribes sought how they might take him by deception, and kill him.
<sup class="v">14:2</sup>But they said, Not at the feast, lest
there be a tumult of the people. <sup class="v">14:3</sup>And when
he was at Bethany, and was reclining at the house of Simon the
leper, a woman came, having a vase of ointment of genuine nard,
extremely costly, and breaking the vase she poured it out on his
head.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">14:4</sup>And some were
displeased, [and said] to themselves, Why was this waste of the
ointment? <sup class="v">14:5</sup>For this ointment could have
been sold for more than three hundred denarii [$42] and given to
the poor; and they blamed her. <sup class="v">14:6</sup>But Jesus
said, Let her alone; why do you trouble her? She has performed a
good work on me. <sup class="v">14:7</sup>The poor you have always
with you, and you can do them good when you will; but me you have
not always. <sup class="v">14:8</sup>She has done what she could.
She anticipated anointing my body for the burial. <sup class=
"v">14:9</sup>I tell you truly, that wherever this good news shall
be preached in all the world, this also which she has done shall be
told for a memorial of her.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">14:10</sup>And Judas Iscariot,
one of the twelve, went to the chief priests to betray him to them.
<sup class="v">14:11</sup>And when they heard him they were glad,
and promised to give him money. And he sought how he might betray
him at a convenient time.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">14:12</sup>And on the first day
of unleavened bread, when they killed the passover, his disciples
said to him, Where do you wish us to go and prepare to eat the
passover? <sup class="v">14:13</sup>And he sent two of his
disciples, and said to them, Go into the city, and a man shall meet
you bearing an earthen pitcher of water. Follow him, <sup class=
"v">14:14</sup>and where he enters in, say to the master of the
house, The teacher says, where is the public room in which I may
eat the passover with my disciples? <sup class="v">14:15</sup>And
he will show you a large upper room, furnished, ready; and there
prepare for us. <sup class="v">14:16</sup>And his disciples went
out, and came into the city, and found as he had said to them, and
prepared the passover.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">14:17</sup>And when it was
evening he came, with the twelve, <sup class="v">14:18</sup>And as
they reclined, and were eating, Jesus said, I tell you truly, that
one of you who eats with me will betray me. <sup class=
"v">14:19</sup>And they were sorry, and said to him, one by one, Is
it I? And another, Is it I? <sup class="v">14:20</sup>And he said
to them, It is one of the twelve who dips with me in the dish.
<sup class="v">14:21</sup>The Son of man goes indeed as it is
written of him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is
betrayed! It would be good for him if that man had not been
born.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">14:22</sup>And as they eat he
took the bread, and having blessed, broke and, gave to them, and
said, Take, this is my body. <sup class="v">14:23</sup>And he took
the cup, and having given thanks gave them, and they all drank of
it. <sup class="v">14:24</sup>And he said to them, This is my blood
of the covenant, which is poured out for many. <sup class=
"v">14:25</sup>I tell you truly, that I will drink of the product
of the vine no more till that day when I drink it new in the
kingdom of God. <sup class="v">14:26</sup>And having sung a hymn
they went out to the Mount of Olives.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST AT THE MOUNT OF OLIVES, AND IN GETHSEMANE.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">14:27</sup>AND Jesus said to
them, You will all be offended; for it is written, I will smite the
shepherd and the sheep shall be scattered; <sup class=
"v">14:28</sup>but after I am raised I will go before you into
Galilee. <sup class="v">14:29</sup>But Peter said to him, Even if
all should be offended, yet I will not. <sup class=
"v">14:30</sup>And Jesus said to him, I tell you truly, that
to-day, on this night, before the cock crows twice, you will deny
me thrice. <sup class="v">14:31</sup>And he said, more strongly, If
it should be necessary for me to die with you I will by no means
deny you; and they all said the same.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">14:32</sup>And they came to a
place which was called Gethsemane; and he said to his disciples,
Sit here, till I pray. <sup class="v">14:33</sup>And he took Peter,
and James, and John with him, and began to be amazed and dejected.
<sup class="v">14:34</sup>And he said to them, My soul is extremely
sorrowful, even to death; remain here and watch. <sup class=
"v">14:35</sup>And going forward a little he fell on the ground,
and prayed that, if it was possible, the hour might pass away from
him. <sup class="v">14:36</sup>And he said, Abba, father, all
things are possible to thee. Take away this cup from me; but not
what I will but what thou wilt. <sup class="v">14:37</sup>And he
came and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, Simon, do you
sleep? Could you not watch one hour? <sup class=
"v">14:38</sup>Watch and pray that you enter not into trial; the
spirit indeed is willing, but flesh is weak. <sup class=
"v">14:39</sup>And again going away he prayed, saying the same
words. <sup class="v">14:40</sup>And again coming he found them
sleeping; for their eyes were heavy; and they knew not what to
answer him. <sup class="v">14:41</sup>And he came a third time, and
said to them, Sleep henceforth, and be refreshed. It is enough; the
hour has come. Behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of
sinners! <sup class="v">14:42</sup>arise, let us go; behold, he
that betrays me is at hand!</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">14:43</sup>And immediately, while
he was yet speaking, Judas the Iscariot, one of the twelve, came,
and with him a great multitude, with swords and clubs, from the
chief priests, and scribes, and elders. <sup class=
"v">14:44</sup>And the traitor had given them this signal, saying,
Whom I shall kiss, he is the one; take him, and lead him away
safely. <sup class="v">14:45</sup>And coming, he immediately
approached him, and said, Rabbi! Rabbi! and kissed him. <sup class=
"v">14:46</sup>And they laid hands on him and took him.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">14:47</sup>And one of those who
stood by drew a sword and struck the servant of the chief priest,
and cut off his car. <sup class="v">14:48</sup>And Jesus answered
and said to them, Have you come out as against a robber, with
swords and clubs to apprehend me? <sup class="v">14:49</sup>I was
daily with you in the temple teaching, and you did not take me. But
[it was done] that the Scriptures might be fulfilled. <sup class=
"v">14:50</sup>And all forsook him and fled. <sup class=
"v">14:51</sup>And one young man followed him with a linen cloth
wrapped about his naked body. And the young men caught him;
<sup class="v">14:52</sup>and leaving the linen cloth he escaped
from them naked.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST BEFORE THE SANHEDRIM, AND BEFORE PILATE.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">14:53</sup>AND they led away
Jesus to the chief priest; and all the chief priests, and elders,
and scribes came together to him. <sup class="v">14:54</sup>And
Peter followed him at a distance, till he came into the court of
the chief priest; and he sat with the officers and warmed himself
before the light. <sup class="v">14:55</sup>And the chief priests
and all the Sanhedrim sought testimony against Jesus to kill him,
and did not find it. <sup class="v">14:56</sup>For many testified
falsely against him, but their testimony did not agree; <sup class=
"v">14:57</sup>and some arose and testified falsely against him,
saying, <sup class="v">14:58</sup>We heard him say, I will destroy
this temple made with hands, and in three days will build another
made without hands. <sup class="v">14:59</sup>And neither in this
did their testimony agree. <sup class="v">14:60</sup>And the chief
priest standing up in the midst asked Jesus, saying, Do you not
answer any thing to what these testify against you? <sup class=
"v">14:61</sup>And he was silent, and answered nothing.</p>
<p class="pin">2 Again the chief priest asked him, and said to
him, Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed? <sup class=
"v">14:62</sup>And Jesus said, I am; and you shall see the Son of
man sitting on the right hand of the power, and coming with the
clouds of heaven. <sup class="v">14:63</sup>And the high priest
rent his clothes, and said, What further need have we of witnesses?
<sup class="v">14:64</sup>You have heard the blasphemy; what do you
think? And they all condemned him to be deserving of death.
<sup class="v">14:65</sup>And some spit on him; and they
blindfolded him, and beat him with the fist, and said to him,
Prophesy. And the officers beat him with open hands.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">14:66</sup>And Peter being in the
court below, one of the female servants of the chief priest came,
<sup class="v">14:67</sup>and seeing Peter warming himself, looked
at him, and said, You also were with Jesus the Nazarene.
<sup class="v">14:68</sup>But he denied it, saying, I do not know
[him]; neither do I know what you say. And he went out into the
porch, and a cock crew. <sup class="v">14:69</sup>And the female
servant seeing him said to those standing by, This is one of them.
<sup class="v">14:70</sup>But he again denied it. And after a short
time those standing by again said to Peter, You are certainly one
of them, for you are also a Galilean. <sup class="v">14:71</sup>And
he cursed and swore, I know not this man of whom you speak.
<sup class="v">14:72</sup>And a cock crew a second time. And Peter
was reminded of the word, how Jesus said to him, Before a cock
crows twice, you will deny me thrice. And he wept bitterly.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">15:1</sup>And immediately in the
morning, the chief priests taking counsel with the elders, and
scribes, and all the Sanhedrim, bound Jesus, and brought and
delivered him to Pilate. <sup class="v">15:2</sup>And Pilate asked
him, Are you the king of the Jews? And Jesus answered and said to
him, As you say. <sup class="v">15:3</sup>And the chief priests
accused him of many things. <sup class="v">15:4</sup>And Pilate
again asked him saying, Do you answer nothing? see how many things
they charge against you. <sup class="v">15:5</sup>And Jesus
answered him not any more; so that Pilate wondered.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">15:6</sup>And at the feast he
released to them a prisoner, whomsoever they chose. <sup class=
"v">15:7</sup>And there was a man called Barabbas, bound with the
insurgents, who had committed murder in a sedition. <sup class=
"v">15:8</sup>And the multitude went up and requested as he had
always done to them. <sup class="v">15:9</sup>And Pilate answered
them, saying, Do you wish me to release to you the king of the
Jews? <sup class="v">15:10</sup>For he knew that the chief priests
had delivered him up from envy. <sup class="v">15:11</sup>But the
chief priests moved the people that he should rather release
Barabbas to them.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">15:12</sup>And Pilate again
answered and said to them, What, then, do you wish me to do to him
whom you call the king of the Jews? <sup class="v">15:13</sup>And
they cried again, Crucify him! <sup class="v">15:14</sup>And Pilate
said to them, [Why]? for what evil has he done? But they cried more
violently, Crucify him! <sup class="v">15:15</sup>And Pilate
wishing to satisfy the multitude released to them Barabbas; and
having scourged Jesus delivered him up to be crucified.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST CRUCIFIED, HIS DEATH, BURIAL AND RESURRECTION.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">15:16</sup>AND the soldiers led
him away into the court which is the Pr&aelig;torium, and called
together all the cohort. <sup class="v">15:17</sup>And they put on
him a purple garment, and plaiting a thorny crown put it on him.
<sup class="v">15:18</sup>And they saluted him, Hail, king of the
Jews! <sup class="v">15:19</sup>And they struck his head with a
reed, and beat him, and kneeling down worshipped him. <sup class=
"v">15:20</sup>And when they had mocked him they took off the
purple garment, and put on him his own clothes, and they led him
away to crucify him, <sup class="v">15:21</sup>and compelled one
Simon, a Cyrenian, who was passing along, coming from the country,
the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">15:22</sup>And they brought him
to Golgotha, which is interpreted A place of a cranium, <sup class=
"v">15:23</sup>and gave him wine mingled with myrrh; but he did not
take it. <sup class="v">15:24</sup>And they crucified him, and
divided his clothes, casting lots for them which should take any
thing. <sup class="v">15:25</sup>And it was the third hour when
they crucified him, <sup class="v">15:26</sup>and the inscription
of his accusation was written, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">15:27</sup>And they crucified
with him two robbers, one on his right hand and the other on his
left. <sup class="v">15:29</sup>And those who passed by reviled
him, wagging their heads, and saying, Aha, you that destroy the
temple and build it in three days! <sup class="v">15:30</sup>save
yourself, and come down from the cross. <sup class=
"v">15:31</sup>In like manner also the chief priests mocking him,
with the scribes, said one to another, He saved others; himself he
cannot save; <sup class="v">15:32</sup>let the Christ, the King of
Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe.
And those crucified with him reproached him.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">15:33</sup>And when it was the
sixth hour, there was darkness over all the earth till the ninth
hour. <sup class="v">15:34</sup>And at the ninth hour Jesus cried
with a loud voice, saying, Eloi! Eloi! lama sabachthani? which is
interpreted, my God! my God! why hast thou forsaken me? <sup class=
"v">15:35</sup>And some of those standing by, hearing him, said,
See, he calls Elijah. <sup class="v">15:36</sup>And one ran, and
filled a sponge with vinegar, and putting it on a reed gave it to
him to drink, saying, Let him alone; let us see if Elijah will come
to take him down.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">15:37</sup>And Jesus crying with
a loud voice, expired. <sup class="v">15:38</sup>And the vail of
the temple was rent in two, from top to bottom; <sup class=
"v">15:39</sup>and the centurion who stood near, opposite to him,
seeing that he so expired, said, Truly, this man was a Son of
God.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">15:40</sup>And the women also saw
from afar, among whom were Mary the Magdalene and Mary the mother
of James the less, and of Joset, and Salome, <sup class=
"v">15:41</sup>who also followed him when he was in Galilee, and
waited on him, and many others who had come up with him to
Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">15:42</sup>And when it was now
evening, because it was the preparation, which is before the
sabbath, <sup class="v">15:43</sup>Joseph came, who was from
Arimathea, an honorable counsellor, who also himself expected the
kingdom of God, and went in boldly to Pilate and asked for the body
of Jesus. <sup class="v">15:44</sup>And Pilate wondered that he was
already dead; and calling the centurion asked him if he had been
dead for some time. <sup class="v">15:45</sup>And knowing [his
death,] from the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph. <sup class=
"v">15:46</sup>And having bought linen, he took him down and
wrapped him in the linen, and placed him in a tomb which was cut
from a rock, and rolled a stone against the door of the tomb.
<sup class="v">15:47</sup>And Mary the Magdalene and Mary the
mother of Joset saw where he was laid.</p>
<p class="pin">8 <sup class="v">16:1</sup>And when the sabbath
was passed, Mary the Magdalene and Mary the mother of James, and
Salome, bought spices, that they might come and anoint him.
<sup class="v">16:2</sup>And very early in the morning, on the
first day of the week, they came to the tomb at the rising of the
sun. <sup class="v">16:3</sup>And they said to themselves, Who will
roll away the stone for us from the door of the tomb?&mdash;
<sup class="v">16:4</sup>and looking up they saw that the stone was
rolled away&mdash;for it was very great.</p>
<p class="pin">9 <sup class="v">16:5</sup>And coming to the tomb
they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed with a
white robe; and they were astonished. <sup class="v">16:6</sup>And
he said to them, Be not astonished; you seek Jesus the Nazarene,
who was crucified. He is raised; he is not here. See the place
where they laid him. <sup class="v">16:7</sup>But go, tell his
disciples and Peter that he goes before you to Galilee; there you
shall see him as he said to you. <sup class="v">16:8</sup>And they
went out and fled from the tomb; and trembling and amazement seized
them; and they said nothing to any one, for they were afraid.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>
<h3>AN ADDITION BY AN UNKNOWN WRITER.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">16:9</sup>AND having arisen early
on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary the
Magdalene from whom he had cast out seven demons. <sup class=
"v">16:10</sup>She went and told those who had been with him, who
were weeping and lamenting; <sup class="v">16:11</sup>and when they
heard that he was alive, and had been seen by her, they did not
believe it.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">16:12</sup>Afterwards he appeared
in another form to two of them as they walked, going into the
country. <sup class="v">16:13</sup>And they went and announced it
to the rest; they did not believe it.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">16:14</sup>And afterwards he
appeared to the eleven, as they reclined, and reproached their
unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not those who
had seen him since he rose from the dead. <sup class=
"v">16:15</sup>And he said to them, Go into all the world, preach
the good news to all the creation; <sup class="v">16:16</sup>he
that believes and is baptized shall be saved, but he that
disbelieves shall be condemned. <sup class="v">16:17</sup>And these
signs shall follow those that believe; in my name they shall cast
out demons, they shall speak with new tongues, <sup class=
"v">16:18</sup>they shall take up serpents, and if they drink any
deadly [poison] it shall not hurt them; and they shall lay hands on
the sick, and they shall be well.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">16:19</sup>Then the Lord, after
speaking with them, was taken up to heaven, and sat on the right
hand of God. <sup class="v">16:20</sup>And they went abroad and
preached everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming the
word by the accompanying miracles.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>
<h3>INTRODUCTION, AND THE TWO ANNUNCIATIONS.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">1:1</sup>SINCE many have
undertaken to arrange a complete digest of the things fully
believed among us, <sup class="v">1:2</sup>as they delivered them
to us who, from the beginning, were eye witnesses and ministers of
the word, <sup class="v">1:3</sup>it seemed good to me also, having
traced all things accurately from the first, to write in order to
you, most excellent Theophilus, <sup class="v">1:4</sup>that you
may know the certainty of the words concerning which you have been
taught.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">1:5</sup>In the days of Herod the
king of Judea, there was a certain priest by the name of Zachariah,
of the class of Abijah; and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron,
and her name was Elizabeth. <sup class="v">1:6</sup>And they were
both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and
ordinances of the Lord blameless. <sup class="v">1:7</sup>And they
had no son, because Elizabeth was barren, and both were advanced in
years.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">1:8</sup>And when he was
performing the priest's office in the order of his class before
God, it fell to his lot, <sup class="v">1:9</sup>according to the
custom of the priesthood, to go into the temple of the Lord to burn
incense; <sup class="v">1:10</sup>and all the multitude of the
people were praying without, at the hour of incense. <sup class=
"v">1:11</sup>And an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing on
the right side of the altar of incense; <sup class=
"v">1:12</sup>and Zachariah was troubled when he saw him, and fear
fell upon him.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">1:13</sup>And the angel said to
him, Fear not, Zachariah, for your prayer is heard, and your wife
Elizabeth shall bear you a son; and you shall call his name John.
<sup class="v">1:14</sup>And he shall be to you a joy and
rejoicing; and many shall rejoice at his birth; <sup class=
"v">1:15</sup>for he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and
shall not drink wine and strong drink, but shall be filled with the
Holy Spirit even from his birth; <sup class="v">1:16</sup>and many
of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God.
<sup class="v">1:17</sup>And he shall go before him in the spirit
and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of fathers to children, and
the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous, to make ready a
people prepared for the Lord. <sup class="v">1:18</sup>And
Zachariah said to the angel, By what shall I know this? for I am an
old man, and my wife advanced in years. <sup class=
"v">1:19</sup>And the angel answered and said to him, I am Gabriel,
who stand before God; and I was sent to speak to you, and to tell
you this good news. <sup class="v">1:20</sup>And behold you shall
be silent, and not able to speak, till the day these things are
accomplished; because you have not believed my words, which shall
be fulfilled in their time.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">1:21</sup>And the people waited
for Zachariah, and wondered that he staid so long in the temple.
<sup class="v">1:22</sup>And when he came out he could not speak to
them; and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple.
And he made signs to them, and continued dumb. <sup class=
"v">1:23</sup>And when the days of his service were completed he
departed to his house. <sup class="v">1:24</sup>And after these
days Elizabeth his wife became pregnant, and hid herself five
months, saying, <sup class="v">1:25</sup>Thus has the Lord dealt
with me, in the days in which he looked upon me to take away my
reproach among men.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">1:26</sup>And in the sixth month
the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a city of Galilee, by the name
of Nazareth, <sup class="v">1:27</sup>to a virgin espoused to a man
whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the name of the
virgin was Mary. <sup class="v">1:28</sup>And coming in to her, he
said, Hail, favored one! The Lord is with you! <sup class=
"v">1:29</sup>And she was troubled at his word, and doubted what
this salutation meant. <sup class="v">1:30</sup>And the angel said
to her, Fear not, Mary, for you have found favor with God.
<sup class="v">1:31</sup>And behold you shall be with child, and
bear a son, and shall call his name Jesus. <sup class=
"v">1:32</sup>He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the
Most High. And the Lord God shall give him the throne of David his
father, <sup class="v">1:33</sup>and he shall reign over the house
of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there shall be no end.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">1:34</sup>And Mary said to the
angel, How shall this be, since I know not a man? <sup class=
"v">1:35</sup>And the angel answered and said to her, The Holy
Spirit shall come upon you, and the power of the Most High shall
overshadow you; and on that account the holy child shall be called
the Son of God. <sup class="v">1:36</sup>And behold Elizabeth, your
relative, even she is pregnant with a son in her old age, and this
is the sixth month to her called barren; <sup class=
"v">1:37</sup>for nothing is impossible with God. <sup class=
"v">1:38</sup>And Mary said, Behold, I am the servant of the Lord!
Let it be to me according to your word. And the angel departed from
her.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<h3>MARYS VISIT TO ELIZABETH, AND THE BIRTH OF JOHN.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">1:39</sup>AND Mary arose in those
days and went in haste to the mountainous country, to the city of
Juda. <sup class="v">1:40</sup>And she went unto the house of
Zachariah and saluted Elizabeth. <sup class="v">1:41</sup>And when
Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her
womb. And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit, <sup class=
"v">1:42</sup>and cried with a loud voice, and said, Blessed are
you among women! and blessed is the fruit of your womb! <sup class=
"v">1:43</sup>And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord
has come to me? <sup class="v">1:44</sup>For, behold, when the
voice of your salutation came to my ears, the babe leaped in my
womb with exultation. <sup class="v">1:45</sup>And blessed is she
that believed; for there shall be an accomplishment of the words
spoken to her by the Lord.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">1:46</sup>And Mary said, My soul
magnifies the Lord, <sup class="v">1:47</sup>and my spirit exults
in God my Saviour; <sup class="v">1:48</sup>for he has looked on
the low condition of his servant; for, behold, from this time all
generations shall call me blessed, <sup class="v">1:49</sup>because
the mighty One has done great things for me, and holy is his name;
<sup class="v">1:50</sup>and his mercy is to generations and
generations of them that fear him. <sup class="v">1:51</sup>He has
made strong his arm; he has scattered the proud with the thought of
their hearts; <sup class="v">1:52</sup>he has brought down the
mighty from thrones, and exalted the humble; <sup class=
"v">1:53</sup>he has filled the hungry with goods, and sent the
rich away empty. <sup class="v">1:54</sup>He has helped Israel his
servant, and remembered his mercy, <sup class="v">1:55</sup>as he
said to our fathers, to Abraham and his posterity forever.
<sup class="v">1:56</sup>And Mary remained with her about three
months, and returned to her house.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">1:57</sup>And when Elizabeth's
time to bear had fully come, she bore a son; <sup class=
"v">1:58</sup>and her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord
had magnified his mercy to her, and congratulated her. <sup class=
"v">1:59</sup>And they came on the eighth day to circumcise the
little child, and called it by the name of its father, Zachariah.
<sup class="v">1:60</sup>And his mother answered and said, No; but
he shall be called John. <sup class="v">1:61</sup>And they said to
her, There is no one of your relations who is called by this name;
<sup class="v">1:62</sup>and they made signs to his father, what he
wished it to be called. <sup class="v">1:63</sup>And asking for a
writing-tablet, he wrote, saying, His name is John. And all
wondered. <sup class="v">1:64</sup>And his mouth was immediately
opened, and his tongue [loosed], and he spoke and blessed God.
<sup class="v">1:65</sup>And fear came on all living around them.
All these things were talked of in all the mountainous country of
Judea. <sup class="v">1:66</sup>And all who heard laid them to
heart, saying, What then is this child to be? For the hand of the
Lord was also with him.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">1:67</sup>And Zachariah his
father was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying,
<sup class="v">1:68</sup>Blessed is the Lord, the God of Israel,
because he has visited and redeemed his people, <sup class=
"v">1:69</sup>and raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house
of David his servant; <sup class="v">1:70</sup>as he said by the
mouth of his holy prophets from of old; <sup class="v">1:71</sup>A
salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us,
<sup class="v">1:72</sup>to perform his mercy with our fathers, and
to remember his holy covenant, <sup class="v">1:73</sup>the oath
which he swore to Abraham our father, <sup class="v">1:74</sup>to
grant us without fear, being delivered from the hand of our
enemies, to serve him <sup class="v">1:75</sup>in holiness and
righteousness before him all our days. <sup class="v">1:76</sup>And
you, little child, shall be called a prophet of the Most High; for
you shall go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways,
<sup class="v">1:77</sup>to give a knowledge of salvation to his
people, with a forgiveness of sins, <sup class="v">1:78</sup>on
account of the compassionate mercies of our God, by which a morning
from on high has visited us, <sup class="v">1:79</sup>to illuminate
those sitting in darkness and the shade of death, to direct our
feet in the way of peace. <sup class="v">1:80</sup>And the child
grew, and became strong in spirit, and was in the wilderness till
the day of his manifestation to Israel.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<h3>THE BIRTH OF CHRIST, HIS INFANCY AND CHILDHOOD.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">2:1</sup>In those days there went
out an ordinance from C&aelig;sar Augustus that a census should be
taken of all the world. <sup class="v">2:2</sup>This first census
was taken when Cyrenius was proconsul of Syria. <sup class=
"v">2:3</sup>And all went to be enrolled, each one to his own city.
<sup class="v">2:4</sup>And Joseph went up from Galilee, from the
city of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David, which is called
Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David,
<sup class="v">2:5</sup>to be enrolled with Mary his espoused
[wife,] who was with child. <sup class="v">2:6</sup>And while they
were there the days for her delivery were completed; <sup class=
"v">2:7</sup>and she bore her first-born son, and wrapped him in
bandages, and laid him in a manger, because there was no room for
them in the khan.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">2:8</sup>And there were shepherds
in that country staying in the fields and watching their flock by
night. <sup class="v">2:9</sup>And behold, an angel of the Lord
came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and
they were greatly afraid. <sup class="v">2:10</sup>And the angel
said to them, Fear not; for, behold, I bring you good news of a
great joy, which shall be for all people. <sup class=
"v">2:11</sup>For to you was born to-day in the city of David, a
Saviour who is the anointed Lord. <sup class="v">2:12</sup>And this
shall be a sign to you. You shall find the babe wrapped in
bandages, lying in a manger. <sup class="v">2:13</sup>And suddenly
there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host, praising
God, and saying, <sup class="v">2:14</sup>Glory to God in the
highest [heavens], on earth peace, and among men good will!</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">2:15</sup>And when the angels had
departed from them to heaven, the shepherds said one to another,
Let us go now to Bethlehem, and see this thing which has occurred,
which the Lord has made known to us. <sup class="v">2:16</sup>And
they came in haste, and found Mary and Joseph, and the babe lying
in the manger. <sup class="v">2:17</sup>And when they saw it they
related the word spoken to them concerning this child; <sup class=
"v">2:18</sup>and all who heard wondered at the things told them by
the shepherds. <sup class="v">2:19</sup>But Mary kept all these
words, revolving them in her mind. <sup class="v">2:20</sup>And the
shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all that they
had heard and seen, as it was told them.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">2:21</sup>And when eight days
were completed, [the time] to circumcise him, his name was called
Jesus, the name given him by the angel before he was conceived in
the womb. <sup class="v">2:22</sup>And when the days of their
purification were completed according to the law of Moses, they
carried him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord, <sup class=
"v">2:23</sup>as it is written in the law of the Lord that every
male which is a first born shall be called holy to the Lord,
<sup class="v">2:24</sup>and to offer a sacrifice according to what
is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtle doves, or two
young pigeons.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">2:25</sup>And behold, there was a
man at Jerusalem whose name was Simeon; and this man was just and
pious, waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit
was on him. <sup class="v">2:26</sup>And he was informed by the
Holy Spirit that he should not see death till he had seen the
Lord's anointed. <sup class="v">2:27</sup>And he came by the spirit
into the temple, and when the parents brought in the child Jesus,
to do according to the custom of the law concerning him,
<sup class="v">2:28</sup>he also took it in his arms, and blessed
God, and said, <sup class="v">2:29</sup>Now, Master, dismiss thy
servant according to thy word, in peace; <sup class=
"v">2:30</sup>for my eyes have seen thy salvation, <sup class=
"v">2:31</sup>which thou hast prepared before all people;
<sup class="v">2:32</sup>a light for enlightening Gentiles, and a
glory of thy people Israel. <sup class="v">2:33</sup>And his father
and mother wondered at the words spoken of him.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">2:34</sup>And Simeon blessed
them, and said to Mary his mother, Behold, this child is set for
the fall and rise of many in Israel, and for a sign spoken against,
<sup class="v">2:35</sup>and a sword shall pierce your own soul
also, that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">2:36</sup>And there was Anna, a
prophetess, a daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher; she was
far advanced in years, having lived with a husband seven years from
her virginity; <sup class="v">2:37</sup>and she had been a widow
eighty-four years, and departed not from the temple, serving God
night and day with fastings and prayers. <sup class=
"v">2:38</sup>And she coming by at that time, praised God, and
spoke of him [the child] to all who expected a redemption in
Jerusalem. <sup class="v">2:39</sup>And when they had finished all
things according to the law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee,
to their city Nazareth. <sup class="v">2:40</sup>And the little
child grew, and became strong, being filled with wisdom; and the
grace of God was upon it.</p>
<p class="pin">8 <sup class="v">2:41</sup>And his parents went up
yearly to Jerusalem to the feast of the passover. <sup class=
"v">2:42</sup>And when he was twelve years old they went up to
Jerusalem, according to the custom of the feast. <sup class=
"v">2:43</sup>And having completed the days, on their return, the
child Jesus remained behind at Jerusalem. And his parents knew it
not. <sup class="v">2:44</sup>But supposing that he was in the
company went a day's journey and sought him among their relations
and acquaintances. <sup class="v">2:45</sup>And not finding him
they returned to Jerusalem to seek him. <sup class=
"v">2:46</sup>And after three days they found him sitting in the
temple in the midst of the teachers, both hearing and questioning
them. <sup class="v">2:47</sup>And all who heard him were
astonished at his understanding and his answers.</p>
<p class="pin">9 <sup class="v">2:48</sup>And when they saw him
they were astonished; and his mother said to him, Son, why have you
dealt thus with us? Behold, your father and I have sought you with
sorrow. <sup class="v">2:49</sup>And he said to them, Why did you
seek me? did you not know that I must be in [the courts] of my
father? <sup class="v">2:50</sup>And they understood not the word
which he spoke to them. <sup class="v">2:51</sup>And he went down
with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject to them. And his
mother kept all these things in her heart. <sup class=
"v">2:52</sup>And Jesus advanced in wisdom and stature, and in
favor with God and men.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<h3>THE MINISTRY OF JOHN THE BAPTIST, CHRIST'S BAPTISM AND
GENEALOGY.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">3:1</sup>AND in the fifteenth
year of the reign of Tiberius C&aelig;sar, Pontius Pilate being
procurator of Judea, and Herod tetrarch of Galilee, and Philip his
brother tetrarch of Ituria and the country of Trachonitis, and
Lysanias being tetrarch of Abilene, <sup class="v">3:2</sup>under
the chief priest Annas, and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John
the son of Zachariah, in the wilderness. <sup class=
"v">3:3</sup>And he went into all the region about the Jordan,
preaching the baptism of a change of mind for the forgiveness of
sins; <sup class="v">3:4</sup>as it is written in the book of the
words of Isaiah the prophet; A voice of one crying in the
wilderness, prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.
<sup class="v">3:5</sup>Every ravine shall be filled up, and every
mountain and hill shall be made low; and the crooked shall be made
straight, and the rough ways smooth; <sup class="v">3:6</sup>and
all flesh shall see the salvation of God.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">3:7</sup>Then John said to the
multitudes who went out to be baptized by him, Offspring of vipers,
who has warned you to flee from the wrath to come? <sup class=

And say not within yourselves, We have Abraham for a father; for I
tell you that God is able from these stones to raise up children to
Abraham. <sup class="v">3:9</sup>And already also the axe lies at
the root of the trees; every tree therefore which bears not good
fruit, is cut down and cast into the fire. <sup class=
"v">3:10</sup>And the multitudes asked him, saying, What then shall
we do? <sup class="v">3:11</sup>And he answered and said to them,
Let him that has two coats give to him that has none; and let him
that has food do the same. <sup class="v">3:12</sup>And publicans,
also, came to be baptized, and said to him, Teacher, what shall we
do? <sup class="v">3:13</sup>And he said to them, Do nothing more
than is appointed for you. <sup class="v">3:14</sup>And the
soldiers asked him, saying, And what shall we do? And he said to
them, Oppress, and falsely accuse, no one; and be contented with
your wages.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">3:15</sup>And the people being in
expectation, and all doubting in their minds concerning John,
whether he was the Christ, <sup class="v">3:16</sup>John answered
all, saying, I indeed baptize you with water, but a mightier than I
is coming, the strings of whose shoes I am not fit to untie; he
shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. <sup class=
"v">3:17</sup>His winnowing shovel is in his hand, and he will
thoroughly clean his threshing floor, and gather the wheat into his
storehouse; but the chaff he will burn with an inextinguishable
fire.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">3:18</sup>With many other
exhortations, also, he preached the good news to the people.
<sup class="v">3:19</sup>But Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by
him on account of Herodias his brother's wife and for all the evil
deeds which Herod had done, <sup class="v">3:20</sup>added also
this to all, and shut up John in prison.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">3:21</sup>And when all the people
were baptized, Jesus also being baptized, and praying, heaven was
opened, <sup class="v">3:22</sup>and the Holy Spirit descended in a
bodily form like a dove upon him; and there was a voice from
heaven, saying, You are my beloved Son; with you I am well
pleased.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">3:23</sup>And Jesus was about
thirty years old, being, as was supposed, the son of Joseph, the
son of Eli, <sup class="v">3:24</sup>the son of Matthat, the son of
Levi, the son of Melchi, the son of Jannai, the son of Joseph,

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST'S FASTING, TEMPTATION, AND THE COMMENCEMENT OF HIS
MINISTRY.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">4:1</sup>AND Jesus, full of the
Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan, and was led by the Spirit in
the wilderness, <sup class="v">4:2</sup>being tempted by the devil
forty days. And he eat nothing in those days; and when they were
completed he was hungry. <sup class="v">4:3</sup>And the devil said
to him, If you are the Son of God, command this stone to become
bread. <sup class="v">4:4</sup>And Jesus answered him, It is
written, that man shall not live by bread alone. <sup class=
"v">4:5</sup>And taking him up he showed him all the kingdoms of
the world in a moment of time. <sup class="v">4:6</sup>And the
devil said to him, All this power will I give you, and the glory of
these; for it is given to me, and I give it to whom I will.
<sup class="v">4:7</sup>If you, therefore, will worship me, it all
shall be yours. <sup class="v">4:8</sup>And Jesus answered and said
to him, It is written, You shall worship the Lord your God, and him
alone shall you serve. <sup class="v">4:9</sup>And he brought him
to Jerusalem and placed him on the pinnacle of the temple, and said
to him, If you are the Son of God, cast yourself down from here;
<sup class="v">4:10</sup>for it is written, He will charge his
angels concerning you, to guard you, <sup class="v">4:11</sup>and
they shall bear you up on their hands, lest at any time you dash
your foot against a stone. <sup class="v">4:12</sup>And Jesus
answered and said to him, It is said, You shall not try the Lord
your God. <sup class="v">4:13</sup>And the devil having finished
all the temptation, departed from him for a time.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">4:14</sup>And Jesus returned with
the power of the Spirit to Galilee; and his fame went out into all
the region around. <sup class="v">4:15</sup>And he taught in their
synagogues, glorified by all.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">4:16</sup>And he came to
Nazareth, where he was brought up, and entered, according to his
custom on the sabbath day, into the synagogue, and stood up to
read. <sup class="v">4:17</sup>And the book of Isaiah the prophet
was given to him. And unrolling the book he found the place where
it was written, <sup class="v">4:18</sup>The Spirit of the Lord is
upon me, because he has anointed me to preach good news to the
poor; he has sent me to proclaim a release to the captives, and a
recovery of sight to the blind, to send the oppressed away free,
<sup class="v">4:19</sup>to proclaim an acceptable year of the
Lord. <sup class="v">4:20</sup>And folding up the book, he gave it
to the minister, and sat down; and the eyes of all in the synagogue
were steadfastly fixed upon him.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">4:21</sup>And he said to them,
To-day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears. <sup class=
"v">4:22</sup>And they all bore him witness, and wondered at the
gracious words which proceeded from his mouth, and said, Is not
this the son of Joseph? <sup class="v">4:23</sup>And he said to
them, You will undoubtedly tell me this proverb; Physician, cure
yourself; things which we heard were done in Capernaum, do also
here in your own country. <sup class="v">4:24</sup>And he said, I
tell you truly, that no prophet is acceptable in his own country.
<sup class="v">4:25</sup>I also tell you of a truth, that there
were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when heaven was
shut up three years and six months, so that there was a great
famine over all the land; <sup class="v">4:26</sup>and to none of
them was Elijah sent, but to Sarepta, of Sidon, to a widow woman.
<sup class="v">4:27</sup>And there were many lepers in Israel in
the time of Elisha the prophet, and none of them was cleansed but
Naaman the Syrian. <sup class="v">4:28</sup>And all in the
synagogue when they heard these things were filled with wrath;
<sup class="v">4:29</sup>and they arose and cast him out of the
city, and led him even to the brow of the mountain on which the
city was built, to precipitate him down. <sup class=
"v">4:30</sup>But he passed through the midst of them and went
away.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST AT CAPERNAUM, AND HIS PREACHING AND MIRACLES IN
GALILEE.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">4:31</sup>AND he went down to
Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them on the sabbath;
<sup class="v">4:32</sup>and they were astonished at his teaching,
for his word was with power. <sup class="v">4:33</sup>And there was
a man in the synagogue having a spirit of an impure demon; and he
cried with a loud voice, <sup class="v">4:34</sup>Alas! what have
you to do with us, Jesus Nazarene? Have you come to destroy us? I
know you who you are, the Holy [Son] of God! <sup class=
"v">4:35</sup>And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hush! and come out of
him. And the demon casting him into the midst came out of him,
doing him no injury. <sup class="v">4:36</sup>And they were all
amazed, and talked with each other, saying, What word is this, that
with authority and power he commands the impure spirits, and they
come out? <sup class="v">4:37</sup>And a report of him went abroad
into every place in the country about.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">4:38</sup>And going up from the
synagogue he entered into the house of Simon. And Simon's
mother-in-law was sick with a violent fever; and they asked him in
her behalf. <sup class="v">4:39</sup>And standing over her he
rebuked the fever, and it left her. And she immediately arose and
waited on them.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">4:40</sup>And when the sun went
down, all who had friends sick with various diseases brought them
to him; and putting his hands on each one of them he cured them;
<sup class="v">4:41</sup>and demons also went out of many, crying
and saying, You are the Son of God! And he rebuked them, and
charged them not to say that they knew him to be the Christ.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">4:42</sup>And when it was day,
coming out he went to a solitary place; and the multitudes sought
him, and came to him, and urged him not to depart from them.
<sup class="v">4:43</sup>But he said to them, I must preach the
good news of the kingdom of God in the other cities also, because
for this am I sent; <sup class="v">4:44</sup>and he preached in the
synagogues of Galilee.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">5:1</sup>And as the multitude
pressed upon him to hear the word of God, and he was standing by
the lake of Gennesaret, <sup class="v">5:2</sup>he saw two boats
standing by the lake; and the fishermen having gone out of them
were washing their nets. <sup class="v">5:3</sup>And entering into
one of the ships, which was Simon's, he asked him to put out a
little from the land, and sat down and taught the multitudes from
the ship. <sup class="v">5:4</sup>And when he ceased speaking, he
said to Simon, Put out into the deep water, and let down your nets
for a draught. <sup class="v">5:5</sup>And Simon answered and said
to him, Master, we have labored all night and taken nothing; but at
your word I will let down the net. <sup class="v">5:6</sup>And
doing this he enclosed a great number of fishes; and their net
broke. <sup class="v">5:7</sup>And he made signs to his companions
in the other ship to come and help him; and they came, and filled
both ships, so that they began to sink. <sup class="v">5:8</sup>And
Simon Peter seeing it fell on his knees to Jesus, saying, Depart
from me, Lord, for I am a sinful man. <sup class="v">5:9</sup>For
he was amazed, and all that were with him, at the draught of fishes
which they had taken. <sup class="v">5:10</sup>So also were James
and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus
said to Simon, Fear not; from this time you shall take men.
<sup class="v">5:11</sup>And bringing the ships to the land they
left all and followed him.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">5:12</sup>And he was in one of
the cities, and behold, a man full of leprosy; and seeing Jesus he
fell on his face, and asked him, saying, Lord, if you will, you can
cleanse me. <sup class="v">5:13</sup>And stretching out his hand he
touched him, saying, I will; be cleansed. And immediately the
leprosy left him. <sup class="v">5:14</sup>And he charged him to
tell no one, but go and show yourself to the priest, and present an
offering for your purification, as Moses commanded, for a testimony
to them. <sup class="v">5:15</sup>And the report concerning him
went abroad extensively; and great multitudes came together to hear
him, and to be cured of their diseases. <sup class=
"v">5:16</sup>And he withdrew into solitary places and prayed.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST FORGIVING SINS, CALLING LEVI, EATING WITH PUBLICANS AND
SINNERS, AND EXPOUNDING THE LAWS OF FASTING AND THE SABBATH.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">5:17</sup>AND on one of those
days he was teaching, and the Pharisees and teachers of the law
were present, having come from every village of Galilee, and of
Judea, and from Jerusalem; and the power of the Lord was present to
cure them. <sup class="v">5:18</sup>And behold, men bringing on a
bed a man who was paralytic; and they sought to bring him in to
place him before him. <sup class="v">5:19</sup>And not finding how
they could bring him in, on account of the multitude, they went up
on the house, and let him down through the tiles, with his little
bed, into the midst before Jesus. <sup class="v">5:20</sup>And
seeing their faith, he said, Man, your sins are forgiven you.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">5:21</sup>And the scribes and
Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this that speaks
blasphemies? who can forgive sins, but God alone? <sup class=
"v">5:22</sup>And Jesus knowing their thoughts answered and said to
them, Why do you reason in your minds? <sup class="v">5:23</sup>in
what is it easier to say, Your sins are forgiven you, than to say,
Arise and walk? <sup class="v">5:24</sup>But that you may know that
the Son of man has power on the earth to forgive sins, he said to
the paralytic, I tell you, arise, and take up your little bed, and
go to your house. <sup class="v">5:25</sup>And he arose immediately
before them, and taking up that on which he had lain departed to
his house, glorifying God. <sup class="v">5:26</sup>And all were
astonished, and glorified God, and were filled with fear, saying,
We have seen strange things to-day.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">5:27</sup>And after these things
he went out and saw a publican by the name of Levi, sitting at the
custom house, and said to him, Follow me. <sup class=
"v">5:28</sup>And leaving all he arose and followed him.
<sup class="v">5:29</sup>And Levi made a great feast for him at his
house; and there was a great multitude of publicans and of others
who reclined with them. <sup class="v">5:30</sup>And the Pharisees
and their scribes complained to his disciples, saying, Why do you
eat and drink with publicans? <sup class="v">5:31</sup>And Jesus
answered and said to them, The well need not a physician, but the
ill. <sup class="v">5:32</sup>I have not come to call the
righteous, but sinners to a change of mind.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">5:33</sup>And they said to him,
The disciples of John fast much and make prayers; and likewise
those of the Pharisees; but yours eat and drink. <sup class=
"v">5:34</sup>And he said to them, Can you make the children of the
bridechamber fast while the bridegroom is with them? <sup class=
"v">5:35</sup>But days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken
from them; then shall they fast in those days.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">5:36</sup>And he spoke also a
parable to them; That no one puts a piece of a new garment on an
old garment; if he does, the new both tears the old, and that from
the new disagrees with the old. <sup class="v">5:37</sup>And no one
puts new wine into old bottles; if he does, the new wine will break
the bottles, and itself be poured out, and the bottles be
destroyed. <sup class="v">5:38</sup>But new wine must be put into
new bottles. <sup class="v">5:39</sup>And no one drinking old wine
desires new; for he says the old is good.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">6:1</sup>And on the second-first
sabbath he went through the grain fields, and his disciples picked
the heads and eat, rubbing them in their hands. <sup class=
"v">6:2</sup>And some of the Pharisees said, Why do you do what is
not lawful on the sabbath? <sup class="v">6:3</sup>And Jesus
answered and said to them, Have you not read what David did when he
was hungry, he and those with him? <sup class="v">6:4</sup>He
entered into the house of God, and took the show bread, and eat,
and gave to those with him, which it was not lawful for any to eat,
except the priests alone. <sup class="v">6:5</sup>And he said to
them, The Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">6:6</sup>And on another sabbath
he went into the synagogue and taught. And there was a man there
whose right hand was withered. <sup class="v">6:7</sup>And the
scribes and Pharisees watched him [to see] if he would perform a
cure on the sabbath, that they might find [something of which] to
accuse him. <sup class="v">6:8</sup>But he knew their thoughts, and
said to the man having the withered hand, Arise, and stand in the
midst. And he arose and stood. <sup class="v">6:9</sup>And Jesus
said to them, I will ask you whether it is lawful on the sabbath to
do good or to do evil? to save a life or to destroy? <sup class=
"v">6:10</sup>And looking round upon them all he said to him,
Stretch out your hand. And he did so; and his hand was restored.
<sup class="v">6:11</sup>And they were filled with madness, and
conferred with each other as to what they should do to Jesus.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST CALLING THE TWELVE APOSTLES.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">6:12</sup>AND in those days he
went out on the mountain to pray, and spent the whole night in
prayer to God. <sup class="v">6:13</sup>And when it was day he
called his disciples; and having chosen twelve of them, whom he
named apostles, <sup class="v">6:14</sup>Simon, whom he also named
Peter, and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and
Bartholomew, <sup class="v">6:15</sup>Matthew and Thomas, James,
the son of Alpheus, and Simon called Zealot, <sup class=
"v">6:16</sup>Judas the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, who
was the traitor, <sup class="v">6:17</sup>he went down with them
and stood on a plain; and a multitude of his disciples, and a great
multitude of the people from all Judea and Jerusalem, and the sea
coast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear him, and to be cured of
their diseases; <sup class="v">6:18</sup>and those troubled with
impure spirits were cured. <sup class="v">6:19</sup>And all the
multitude sought to touch him, for a power went out from him and
cured all.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">6:20</sup>And he lifted up his
eyes upon his disciples and said, Blessed are you poor, for yours
is the kingdom of God. <sup class="v">6:21</sup>Blessed are you
that hunger now, for you shall be filled. Blessed are you that weep
now, for you shall laugh. <sup class="v">6:22</sup>Blessed are you
when men shall hate you, and when they shall exclude you from their
company, and reproach and cast out your names as evil, on account
of the Son of man. <sup class="v">6:23</sup>Rejoice in that day,
and be exceedingly glad; for behold, your reward is great in
heaven. For in this manner did their fathers to the prophets.
<sup class="v">6:24</sup>But woe to you rich! for you have your
consolation. <sup class="v">6:25</sup>Woe to you full! for you
shall be hungry. Woe to you who laugh now! for you shall mourn and
weep. <sup class="v">6:26</sup>Woe, when all men speak well of you!
for in this manner did their fathers of the false prophets.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">6:27</sup>But I tell you that
hear, Love your enemies; do good to those that hate you;
<sup class="v">6:28</sup>bless those that curse you; pray for those
that injure you; <sup class="v">6:29</sup>to him that strikes you
on the cheek, present also the other; and forbid not him who takes
away your cloak to take your coat also. <sup class=
"v">6:30</sup>Give to every one that asks; and from him who takes
that which is yours, ask it not back. <sup class="v">6:31</sup>And
as you wish men to do to you, do you also in like manner to them.
<sup class="v">6:32</sup>And if you love those that love you, what
thanks have you? for sinners also love those that love them.
<sup class="v">6:33</sup>And if you do good to those who do good to
you, what thanks have you? for sinners do the same. <sup class=
"v">6:34</sup>And if you lend to those from whom you hope to
receive, what thanks have you? sinners also lend to sinners, to
receive back as much again. <sup class="v">6:35</sup>But love your
enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing in return; and
your reward shall be great, and you shall be children of the Most
High; for he is good to the unthankful and evil. <sup class=
"v">6:36</sup>Be merciful, as your father is merciful; <sup class=
"v">6:37</sup>and judge not, and you shall not be judged; and
condemn not, and you shall not be condemned; release, and you shall
be released; <sup class="v">6:38</sup>give, and it shall be given
to you; good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over,
shall they give into your bosom. For with what measure you measure
it shall be measured back to you.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">6:39</sup>And he spoke also a
parable to them; Can the blind lead the blind? Will not both fall
into the pit? <sup class="v">6:40</sup>A disciple is not above his
teacher, but every perfect one will be as his teacher. <sup class=
"v">6:41</sup>And why do you see the speck in your brother's eye,
and observe not the beam in your own eye? <sup class=
"v">6:42</sup>How can you say to your brother, Brother, let me cast
out the speck in your eye, and you yourself see not the beam in
your own eye? Hypocrite, cast out first the beam from your eye, and
then you will see clearly to cast out the speck from your brother's
eye. <sup class="v">6:43</sup>For there is no good tree which bears
bad fruit, nor, again, a bad tree which bears good fruit.
<sup class="v">6:44</sup>For every tree is known by its own fruit.
For they do not gather figs from thorns, nor do they pick grapes
from brambles. <sup class="v">6:45</sup>The good man out of the
good treasury of his heart brings forth good, and the evil man out
of the evil brings forth evil; for out of the abundance of the
heart its mouth speaks.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">6:46</sup>And why do you call me
Lord! Lord! and do not what I say? <sup class="v">6:47</sup>Every
one that comes to me, and hears my words and does them, I will show
you whom he is like. <sup class="v">6:48</sup>He is like a man
building a house, who dug and went deep, and laid the foundation on
the rock; and when there was a flood, the stream beat against that
house and could not shake it, because it was built on a rock.
<sup class="v">6:49</sup>But he that hears and does not, is like a
man building a house on the earth, without a foundation, against
which the stream beat, and it fell immediately; and the ruin of
that house was great.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST AT CAPERNAUM AND NAIN, HIS REPLY TO JOHN THE BAPTIST,
ETC.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">7:1</sup>WHEN he had finished all
his discourses in the hearing of the people, he entered into
Capernaum. <sup class="v">7:2</sup>And a certain centurion's
servant, who was dear to him, was sick, and about to die;
<sup class="v">7:3</sup>and he hearing of Jesus, sent to him the
elders of the Jews, asking him to come and cure his servant.
<sup class="v">7:4</sup>And having come to Jesus they besought him
earnestly, saying, He is worthy for whom you should do this;
<sup class="v">7:5</sup>for he loves our nation, and has built us a
synagogue. <sup class="v">7:6</sup>And Jesus went with them. And
when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends
to him, saying, Lord, trouble not yourself, for I am not fit that
you should come under my roof. <sup class="v">7:7</sup>Wherefore I
did not think myself worthy to come to you; but say the word, and
my servant shall be cured; <sup class="v">7:8</sup>for I also am a
man placed under authority, having soldiers under me, and I say to
one, Go, and he goes, and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my
servant, Do this, and he does it. <sup class="v">7:9</sup>And Jesus
hearing these things wondered at him, and turning around said to
the multitude following him, I tell you I have not found in Israel
so great a faith; <sup class="v">7:10</sup>and those sent returning
to the house found the sick servant well.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">7:11</sup>And on the next day he
went to a city called Nain, and a considerable number of his
disciples and a great multitude went with him. <sup class=
"v">7:12</sup>And as he approached the gate of the city, behold, a
dead man was carried out, an only son of his mother, and she was a
widow. And a great multitude from the city was with her.
<sup class="v">7:13</sup>And seeing her, the Lord had compassion on
her, and said to her, Weep not. <sup class="v">7:14</sup>And
approaching he touched the bier, and those who bore it stopped. And
he said, Young man, I tell you, arise! <sup class="v">7:15</sup>And
the dead sat up, and began to speak; and he gave him to his mother.
<sup class="v">7:16</sup>And fear seized all; and they glorified
God, saying, A great prophet is raised up among us; and, God has
visited his people. <sup class="v">7:17</sup>And this report of him
went out into all Judea, and into all the region around.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">7:18</sup>And his disciples told
John of all these things. <sup class="v">7:19</sup>And calling two
of his disciples, John sent to the Lord, saying, Are you he that
was to come, or look we for another? <sup class="v">7:20</sup>And
coming to him the men said, John the Baptist has sent us to you to
say, Are you he that was to come, or look we for another?
<sup class="v">7:21</sup>And in that hour he cured many of
diseases, and plagues, and of evil spirits, and gave sight to many
blind. <sup class="v">7:22</sup>And Jesus answered and said to
them, Go and tell John what you have seen and heard; that the blind
see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the
dead are raised up, and the poor have the good news preached to
them; <sup class="v">7:23</sup>and blessed is he who shall not be
offended with me.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">7:24</sup>And when the messengers
of John had gone away, he said to the multitudes concerning John,
What went you out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with a
wind? <sup class="v">7:25</sup>But what went you out to see? A man
dressed in fine clothes? Behold, those who wear fine clothes, and
live in luxury, are in royal palaces. <sup class="v">7:26</sup>But
what went you out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than
a prophet. <sup class="v">7:27</sup>This is he of whom it is
written; Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who shall
prepare your way before you. <sup class="v">7:28</sup>I tell you,
that among those born of women there is no greater prophet than
John; but the least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.
<sup class="v">7:29</sup>And all the people who heard this, and the
publicans, justified God, having received the baptism of John.
<sup class="v">7:30</sup>But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the
counsel of God as to themselves, not having been baptized by
him.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">7:31</sup>[And he said], To what
then shall I compare the men of this generation? and what are they
like? <sup class="v">7:32</sup>They are like little children
sitting in the market, and they call to each other, saying, We have
played on pipes to you, and you have not danced; we have mourned to
you, and you have not lamented. <sup class="v">7:33</sup>For John
the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you
say, He has a demon. <sup class="v">7:34</sup>The Son of man has
come eating and drinking, and you say, Behold a glutton and a wine
drinker! a friend of publicans and sinners! <sup class=
"v">7:35</sup>And Wisdom is justified by all her children.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST ANOINTED BY THE WOMAN, HIS TRAVELS AND ATTENDANTS, THE
PARABLE OF THE SOWER.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">7:36</sup>AND one of the
Pharisees asked him to eat with him; and going into the Pharisee's
house he reclined. <sup class="v">7:37</sup>And behold, a certain
woman in the city, a sinner, knowing that he was reclining in the
house of the Pharisee, brought a vase of ointment, <sup class=
"v">7:38</sup>and standing behind, by his feet, weeping, washed his
feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head; and she
kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment. <sup class=
"v">7:39</sup>And the Pharisee who invited him, seeing it, spoke
within himself, saying, If this was a prophet he would have known
who and what kind of a woman this is who touches him; for she is a
sinner.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">7:40</sup>And Jesus answered and
said to him, Simon, I have something to say to you. And he said,
Teacher, say it. <sup class="v">7:41</sup>A certain creditor had
two debtors; one owed him five hundred denarii [$70], and the other
fifty [$7]. <sup class="v">7:42</sup>And having nothing to pay, he
gave [the debt] to both. Tell me, therefore, which of them will
love him most? <sup class="v">7:43</sup>Simon answered and said, I
suppose the one to whom he gave most. And he said to him, You have
judged rightly. <sup class="v">7:44</sup>And turning to the woman,
he said to Simon, Do you see this woman? I came into your house;
you gave me no water for my feet; but she has wet my feet with
tears, and wiped them with her hairs. <sup class="v">7:45</sup>You
gave me no kiss; but she, from the time that I came in, has not
ceased to kiss my feet. <sup class="v">7:46</sup>You anointed not
my head with oil; but she has anointed my feet with ointment.
<sup class="v">7:47</sup>Therefore, I tell you, her sins, which are
many, are forgiven; for she has loved much; but he to whom little
is forgiven, loves little. <sup class="v">7:48</sup>And he said to
her, Your sins are forgiven. <sup class="v">7:49</sup>And those who
reclined with him said within themselves, Who is this that forgives
sins also? <sup class="v">7:50</sup>And he said to the woman, Your
faith has saved you; go in peace.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">8:1</sup>And he travelled in
order through the cities and villages, proclaiming and preaching
the good news of the kingdom of God; and the twelve were with him,
<sup class="v">8:2</sup>and certain women who had been cured of
evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, from whom went
out seven demons, <sup class="v">8:3</sup>and Joanna the wife of
Chusa, Herod's steward, and Susannah, and many others, who served
them with their property.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">8:4</sup>And a great multitude
having come together, and persons having come to him from every
city, he said in a parable, <sup class="v">8:5</sup>A sower went
out to sow his seed; and in his sowing, some fell by the way, and
was trodden down, and the birds of heaven devoured it; <sup class=
"v">8:6</sup>and some fell on the rock, and springing up it was
dried up, because it had no moisture; <sup class="v">8:7</sup>and
some fell in the midst of thorns, and the thorns springing up
choked it; <sup class="v">8:8</sup>and some fell on good ground,
and growing up bore fruit a hundred fold. Having said these things,
he cried, He that has ears to hear, let him hear.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">8:9</sup>And his disciples asked
him, What does this parable mean? <sup class="v">8:10</sup>And he
said, It is given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of
God, but to others in parables; that seeing they may not see, and
hearing they may not understand. <sup class="v">8:11</sup>But the
parable signifies this; the seed is the word of God; <sup class=
"v">8:12</sup>those by the way are those who hear, then comes the
devil and takes away the word from their hearts, that they may not
believe and be saved; <sup class="v">8:13</sup>those on the rock
are those who, when they hear, receive the word with joy, and they
have no root; they believe for a time, and in a time of trial fall
away; <sup class="v">8:14</sup>and that which fell among thorns
signifies those who hear, and going away are choked by cares and
riches and the pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to
perfection. <sup class="v">8:15</sup>But that on the good ground
signifies those who, with a noble and good heart, hearing the word
retain it, and bear fruit persistently.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">8:16</sup>But no one lights a
candle and covers it with a vessel, or puts it under a bed; but he
puts it in a candlestick, that those coming in may see the light.
<sup class="v">8:17</sup>For there is nothing hid which shall not
be manifest, nor concealed which shall not be known and come to
light. <sup class="v">8:18</sup>See therefore how you hear; for
whoever has, to him shall be given, and whoever has not, from him
shall be taken away even what he seems to have.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">8:19</sup>And his mother and
brothers came to him, and were not able to approach him on account
of the multitude. <sup class="v">8:20</sup>And it was told him by
some, saying, Your mother and your brothers stand without, wishing
to see you. <sup class="v">8:21</sup>And he answered and said to
them, My mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of God
and perform it.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST STILLING A TEMPEST, CURING A DEMONIAC, RAISING THE
DAUGHTER OF JAIRUS.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">8:22</sup>AND on one of those
days both he and his disciples went into the ship; and he said to
them, Let us cross over to the other side of the lake. And they set
sail; <sup class="v">8:23</sup>and as they were sailing he fell
asleep. And a tempest of wind came down on the lake, and they were
flooded with water, and in peril. <sup class="v">8:24</sup>And they
came and awoke him, saying, Master! Master! we are perishing! And
he arose, and rebuked the wind and the waves, and they ceased, and
there was a calm. <sup class="v">8:25</sup>And he said to them,
Where is your faith? And they were afraid, and wondered, saying one
to another, What man then is this, that he commands the winds and
the water and they obey him?</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">8:26</sup>And they sailed to the
country of the Gerasenes, which is opposite to Galilee. <sup class=
"v">8:27</sup>And as he went out on the land, there met him a
certain man from the city who had had demons for a long time; and
he wore no clothes, and remained not in a house, but in the tombs.
<sup class="v">8:28</sup>And seeing Jesus, he cried out, and
worshipped him, and said with a loud voice, What have you to do
with me, Jesus, son of the Most High God? I beg of you not to
torment me; <sup class="v">8:29</sup>for he had commanded the
impure spirit to go out of the man; for it had often seized him;
and he had been bound with chains, and confined with fetters; and
breaking his bonds he had been driven by the demon into solitary
places. <sup class="v">8:30</sup>And Jesus asked him, saying, What
is your name? And he said, Legion; because many demons had entered
into him. <sup class="v">8:31</sup>And he besought him not to
command them to go into the abyss. <sup class="v">8:32</sup>And
there was a herd of many swine feeding on the mountain, and they
besought him to permit them to enter into them; and be permitted
them. <sup class="v">8:33</sup>And the demons going out of the man
entered into the swine; and the herd rushed down the precipice into
the lake and were drowned.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">8:34</sup>And those who fed them,
seeing what was done, fled and reported it in the city and in the
country places. <sup class="v">8:35</sup>And they went out to see
what had happened, and came to Jesus, and found the man from whom
the demons had gone out sitting, clothed and of a sound mind, at
the feet of Jesus; and they were afraid. <sup class=
"v">8:36</sup>And those who had seen related to them how the
demoniac had been cured. <sup class="v">8:37</sup>And all the
multitude of the region about the Gerasenes requested him to depart
from them, because they were seized with great fear. And entering
into the ship, he returned. <sup class="v">8:38</sup>And the man
from whom the demons had gone out desired to be with him; but he
sent him away, saying, <sup class="v">8:39</sup>Return to your
house, and declare how great things God has done for you. And he
went away proclaiming in all the city what great things Jesus had
done for him.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">8:40</sup>And when Jesus returned
the multitude received him; for they were all waiting for him.
<sup class="v">8:41</sup>And behold, a man by the name of Jairus
came; and he was the ruler of a synagogue. And falling at the feet
of Jesus, he besought him to come to his house, <sup class=
"v">8:42</sup>for he had an only daughter twelve years old, and she
was dying. And when he was going, the multitudes thronged him.
<sup class="v">8:43</sup>And a woman having a hemorrhage of twelve
years, who had spent all her living on physicians, and could not be
cured by any one, <sup class="v">8:44</sup>coming up behind,
touched the fringe of his garment, and immediately her flow of
blood was stopped. <sup class="v">8:45</sup>And Jesus said, Who
touched me? And all denying, Peter and those with him said, Master,
the multitudes press upon and throng you, and do you say, Who
touched me? <sup class="v">8:46</sup>And Jesus said, Some one
touched me; for I perceived a power going from me. <sup class=
"v">8:47</sup>And the woman seeing that she was not concealed, came
trembling, and falling down related to him in the presence of all
the people for what cause she had touched him, and how she was
immediately cured. <sup class="v">8:48</sup>And he said to her,
Daughter, your faith has cured you; go in peace.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">8:49</sup>While he was yet
speaking some one came from the synagogue ruler's house and said to
him, Your daughter has died; trouble not the teacher. <sup class=
"v">8:50</sup>But Jesus hearing it answered him, Fear not; only
believe, and she shall be cured. <sup class="v">8:51</sup>And when
he entered into the house, he permitted no one to go in with him,
except Peter, and John, and James, and the father and mother of the
child. <sup class="v">8:52</sup>And all wept and lamented her. But
he said, Weep not; she is not dead, but sleeps. <sup class=
"v">8:53</sup>And they laughed at him, knowing that she was dead.
<sup class="v">8:54</sup>And taking her hand, he called, saying,
Child, arise! <sup class="v">8:55</sup>And her spirit returned, and
she arose immediately. And he commanded food to be given her.
<sup class="v">8:56</sup>And her parents were astonished; and he
commanded them to tell no one what was done.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST ENDOWING THE TWELVE APOSTLES WITH MIRACULOUS POWERS, THE
PERPLEXITY OF HEROD, THE FEEDING OF THE FIVE THOUSAND, PETER'S
CONFESSION, ETC.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">9:1</sup>AND calling together the
twelve, he gave them power and authority over all demons, and to
cure diseases, <sup class="v">9:2</sup>and sent them out to
proclaim the kingdom of God, and to cure the sick. <sup class=
"v">9:3</sup>And he said to them, Take for the way neither a staff
nor a provision sack, nor bread, nor silver, and have not two coats
apiece. <sup class="v">9:4</sup>And into whatever house you enter,
there remain and thence depart. <sup class="v">9:5</sup>And whoever
does not receive you, when you go out of that city shake off the
dust from your feet for a testimony to them. <sup class=
"v">9:6</sup>And they went out and passed through the villages,
everywhere proclaiming the good news and performing cures.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">9:7</sup>And Herod the tetrarch
heard all things which were done, and was perplexed, because it was
said by some that John was raised from the dead, <sup class=
"v">9:8</sup>and by some that Elijah had appeared, and by others
that one of the old prophets had arisen. <sup class=
"v">9:9</sup>And Herod said, John I beheaded; but who is this, of
whom I hear such things? And he sought to see him.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">9:10</sup>And the apostles
returned and reported to him all things which they had done. And
taking them aside, he departed privately to the city called
Bethsaida. <sup class="v">9:11</sup>And the multitudes knowing it
followed him. And having received them, he spoke to them of the
kingdom of God, and cured those having need of cure. <sup class=
"v">9:12</sup>And the day began to decline; and the twelve came and
said to him, Dismiss the multitude, that they may go to the
villages and farms around, and lodge, and find provisions; for we
are here in a solitary place. <sup class="v">9:13</sup>And he said
to them, Give them something to eat. And they said, We have not
more than five loaves and two fishes, unless we go and buy
provisions for all this multitude; <sup class="v">9:14</sup>for
they were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples,
Make them recline in companies of fifty each; <sup class=
"v">9:15</sup>and they did so, and caused them all to recline.
<sup class="v">9:16</sup>And taking the five loaves and two fishes,
and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and broke, and gave to
the disciples to set before the multitude. <sup class=
"v">9:17</sup>And they eat and were all filled; and there was taken
up what remained over to them, twelve traveling-baskets of
fragments.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">9:18</sup>And when he was praying
alone, the disciples came to him, and he asked them, saying, Who do
the multitudes say that I am? <sup class="v">9:19</sup>And they
answered and said, John the Baptist; and some Elijah, and others
that one of the old prophets has arisen. <sup class=
"v">9:20</sup>And he said to them, Who do you say that I am? And
Peter answered and said, The Christ of God. <sup class=
"v">9:21</sup>And he charged and commanded them to tell this to no
one; <sup class="v">9:22</sup>saying, The Son of man must suffer
many things, and be rejected by the elders, and chief priests, and
scribes, and be killed, and be raised on the third day.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">9:23</sup>And he said to all, If
any one wishes to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up
his cross, and follow me. <sup class="v">9:24</sup>For whoever
wishes to save his life, shall lose it; and whoever shall lose his
life for my sake, shall save it. <sup class="v">9:25</sup>For what
is a man profited if he gains the whole world and destroys himself,
or loses his life? <sup class="v">9:26</sup>For whoever is ashamed
of me and of my words, of him will the Son of man be ashamed, when
he comes in his glory, and that of the Father, and of the holy
angels. <sup class="v">9:27</sup>And I tell you of a truth, there
are some of those standing here who shall not taste death till they
see the kingdom of God.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST TRANSFIGURED, CURING A DEMONIAC, AND REPROVING
AMBITION.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">9:28</sup>AND about eight days
after these words, taking Peter, and James, and John, he went up on
the mountain to pray. <sup class="v">9:29</sup>And while he was
praying, the appearance of his face was changed, and his clothes
became white and shining; <sup class="v">9:30</sup>and behold, two
men conversed with him, who were Moses and Elijah, <sup class=
"v">9:31</sup>who appearing in glory spoke of his departure which
he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem. <sup class=
"v">9:32</sup>And Peter and those with him were oppressed with
sleep; and when they awoke they saw his glory, and the two men
standing with him. <sup class="v">9:33</sup>And when they were
departing from him, Peter said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us
to be here; and let us make three tabernacles; one for you, and one
for Moses, and one for Elijah; not knowing what he said.
<sup class="v">9:34</sup>And when he had said this, a cloud came
and overshadowed them; and they were afraid when they entered into
the cloud. <sup class="v">9:35</sup>And there was a voice from the
cloud, saying, This is my chosen Son; hear him. <sup class=
"v">9:36</sup>And when the voice had passed, Jesus was found alone.
And they were silent and told no man in those days any thing of
what they had seen.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">9:37</sup>And on the next day,
when they came down from the mountain, a great multitude met him.
<sup class="v">9:38</sup>And behold, a man from the multitude
cried, saying, Teacher, I desire you to look upon my son, for he is
my only child; <sup class="v">9:39</sup>and behold a spirit takes
him, and suddenly cries out and convulses him, with foam and
crushing him departs from him with difficulty; <sup class=
"v">9:40</sup>and I desired your disciples to cast it out, and they
could not. <sup class="v">9:41</sup>And Jesus answered and said, O
faithless and perverse generation! How long shall I be with you,
and suffer you! Bring your son hither. <sup class="v">9:42</sup>And
while he was coming, the demon tore him with spasms and convulsed
him. And Jesus rebuked the impure spirit, and cured the child, and
gave him back to his father. <sup class="v">9:43</sup>And they were
all astonished at the majesty of God.</p>
<p class="pin">3 And while all wondered at all things which he
did, he said to his disciples, <sup class="v">9:44</sup>Commit
these words to your ears; for the Son of man is about to be
delivered into the hands of men. <sup class="v">9:45</sup>But they
understood not this saying; and it was concealed from them, that
they might not perceive it; and they feared to ask him concerning
this saying.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">9:46</sup>And there arose a
debate among them, which of them should be the greatest.
<sup class="v">9:47</sup>And Jesus perceiving the debate in their
minds, took a little child and set it by him, <sup class=
"v">9:48</sup>and said to them, Whoever receives this little child
in my name, receives me; and whoever receives me, receives him that
sent me. For he that is least among you all, he shall be the
greatest. <sup class="v">9:49</sup>And John answered and said,
Master, we saw one casting out demons in your name, and we forbade
him, because he follows not with us. <sup class="v">9:50</sup>And
Jesus said to him, Forbid him not; for whoever is not against us is
for us.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST ON HIS LAST JOURNEY FROM GALILEE TO JERUSALEM.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">9:51</sup>AND when the days were
completed for his being taken up, he set his face firmly to go to
Jerusalem. <sup class="v">9:52</sup>And he sent messengers before
him; and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans,
to prepare for him. <sup class="v">9:53</sup>And they did not
receive him, because he was going to Jerusalem. <sup class=
"v">9:54</sup>And his disciples James and John seeing it, said,
Lord, do you wish us to call fire to come down from heaven and
consume them? <sup class="v">9:55</sup>And he turned around and
rebuked them; and they went to another village.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">9:57</sup>And as they were
traveling on the way, one said to him, I will follow you wherever
you go. <sup class="v">9:58</sup>And Jesus said to him, The foxes
have holes, and the birds of heaven places of shelter; but the Son
of man has not where to lay his head. <sup class="v">9:59</sup>And
he said to another, Follow me. And he said, Lord, permit me first
to go and bury my father. <sup class="v">9:60</sup>But he said to
him, Let the dead bury their dead, but do you go and proclaim
abroad the kingdom of God. <sup class="v">9:61</sup>And another
also said, Lord, I will follow you, but permit me first to bid
farewell to those in my house. <sup class="v">9:62</sup>But Jesus
said, No man putting his hand on the plow, and looking back, is fit
for the kingdom of God.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">10:1</sup>And after these things
the Lord designated seventy others also, and sent them out, two by
two, before his face, into every city and place where he was about
to come. <sup class="v">10:2</sup>And he said to them, The harvest
indeed is great, but the laborers few; pray, therefore, the Lord of
the harvest to thrust out laborers into his harvest. <sup class=
"v">10:3</sup>Go; behold I send you as lambs in the midst of
wolves. <sup class="v">10:4</sup>Carry neither a purse, nor
provision sack, nor sandals; and salute no one by the way.
<sup class="v">10:5</sup>And into whatever house you enter, first
say, Peace to this house! <sup class="v">10:6</sup>And if a son of
peace is there, your peace shall rest upon him; but if not, it
shall return to you. <sup class="v">10:7</sup>And in the same house
remain, eating and drinking the things with them; for the laborer
is worthy of his reward. Go not about from house to house.
<sup class="v">10:8</sup>And into whatever city you enter, and they
receive you, eat what is set before you; <sup class=
"v">10:9</sup>and cure the sick in it, and say to them, The kingdom
of God has come nigh to you. <sup class="v">10:10</sup>And into
whatever city you enter, and they receive you not, going out into
its streets, say, <sup class="v">10:11</sup>Even the dust of your
city which adheres to our feet we wipe off for you; but know this,
that the kingdom of God is at hand. <sup class="v">10:12</sup>I
tell you, it shall be more tolerable for Sodom in that day than for
that city. <sup class="v">10:13</sup>Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to
you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and
Sidon which have been done in you, they would long ago have changed
their minds, sitting in sackcloth and ashes. <sup class=
"v">10:14</sup>But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in
the judgment, than for you. <sup class="v">10:15</sup>And you,
Capernaum, even to heaven will you be exalted? even to hades shall
you be cast down. <sup class="v">10:16</sup>He that hears you,
hears me; and he that rejects you, rejects me; and he that rejects
me, rejects him that sent me.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">10:17</sup>And the seventy
returned with joy, saying, Lord, even the demons are subject to us
by your name. <sup class="v">10:18</sup>And he said to them, I saw
Satan fall like lightning from heaven. <sup class=
"v">10:19</sup>Behold, I give you power to tread on serpents and
scorpions, and on all the power of the enemy; and nothing shall by
any means injure you; <sup class="v">10:20</sup>but in this rejoice
not, that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that your
names are written in heaven.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">10:21</sup>In the same hour he
rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank thee Father, Lord of heaven
and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and
intelligent, and revealed them to babes. Yes, Father, for so it has
seemed good in thy sight. <sup class="v">10:22</sup>And turning to
his disciples, he said, All things are delivered to me by my
Father; and no one knows who the Son is, but the Father; and who
the Father is but the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal
him. <sup class="v">10:23</sup>And turning around to his disciples
he said privately, Blessed are the eyes which see what you see!
<sup class="v">10:24</sup>For I tell you that many prophets and
kings have desired to see the things which you see, and have not
seen them, and to hear the things which you hear, and have not
heard them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>
<h3>THE WAY OF SALVATION, MARY'S CHOICE, AND LESSONS ON
PRAYER.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">10:25</sup>AND behold, a certain
lawyer stood up to try him, saying, Teacher, what shall I do to
inherit eternal life? <sup class="v">10:26</sup>And he said to him,
What is written in the law? how do you read? <sup class=
"v">10:27</sup>And he answered and said, You shall love the Lord
your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all
your strength, and with all your mind, and your neighbor as
yourself. <sup class="v">10:28</sup>And he said to him, You have
answered well; do this, and you shall live.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">10:29</sup>But he, wishing to
justify himself, said to Jesus, And who is my neighbor? <sup class=
"v">10:30</sup>And Jesus replied and said, A certain man went down
from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among robbers, who both
stripped him and inflicted blows upon him, and went away leaving
him half dead. <sup class="v">10:31</sup>And, providentially, a
certain priest went down that way, and seeing him passed by on the
other side. <sup class="v">10:32</sup>And in like manner a Levite
also, being at the place, came and saw him, and passed by on the
other side. <sup class="v">10:33</sup>But a certain Samaritan, on a
journey, came where he was, and seeing him had compassion on him;
<sup class="v">10:34</sup>and he came and bound up his wounds,
pouring on oil and wine; and putting him on his own beast, brought
him to a khan, and took care of him. <sup class="v">10:35</sup>And
on the next day, putting out two denarii [28 cents], he gave them
to the khan-keeper, and said, Take care of him, and whatever you
expend more, when I return I will pay you. <sup class=
"v">10:36</sup>Which of these three think you was a neighbor to him
who fell among the robbers? <sup class="v">10:37</sup>And he said,
He that had mercy on him. Then said Jesus to him, Do you go and do
likewise.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">10:38</sup>And as they were
pursuing their journey he entered into a certain village. And a
woman by the name of Martha received him into her house.
<sup class="v">10:39</sup>And she had a sister called Mary, and she
sat at the feet of the Lord and heard his word. <sup class=
"v">10:40</sup>But Martha was distracted with much serving, and
came and said, Lord, do you not care that my sister has left me to
serve alone? Tell her, therefore, to help me. <sup class=
"v">10:41</sup>And the Lord answered and said to her, Martha,
Martha, you are anxious and disturbed about many things,
<sup class="v">10:42</sup>but of one thing there is need; and Mary
has chosen the good part, which shall not be taken away from
her.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">11:1</sup>And as he was in a
certain place praying, when he ceased one of his disciples said to
him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.
<sup class="v">11:2</sup>And he said to them, When you pray, say,
Father, hallowed be thy name; thy kingdom come; <sup class=
"v">11:3</sup>give us daily our essential bread; <sup class=
"v">11:4</sup>and forgive us our sins, for we ourselves also
forgive every one who is indebted to us; and bring us not into
trial.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">11:5</sup>And he said to them,
Which of you shall have a friend, and go to him at midnight, and
say, Friend, lend me three loaves, <sup class="v">11:6</sup>for a
friend of mine has come to me from a journey, and I have nothing to
set before him; <sup class="v">11:7</sup>and he will answer from
within, and say, Trouble me not, for the door is already shut, and
my little children are with me in bed, I cannot arise and give you;
<sup class="v">11:8</sup>I tell you if he will not arise and give
him on account of being his friend, yet, on account of his
importunity, he will arise and give him as many as he needs.
<sup class="v">11:9</sup>And I tell you, Ask, and it shall be given
you; seek, and you shall find; knock, and it shall be opened to
you; <sup class="v">11:10</sup>for every one that asks, receives;
and he that seeks, finds; and to him that knocks, it shall be
opened. <sup class="v">11:11</sup>And what father is there of you,
who, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone? or if he
asks also for a fish, will for a fish give him a serpent?
<sup class="v">11:12</sup>or if he asks also for an egg, will give
him a scorpion? <sup class="v">11:13</sup>If you then, being evil,
know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more shall
the Father from heaven give the Holy Spirit to them that ask
him.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST DEFENDS THE DIVINE CHARACTER OF HIS MIRACLES, AND
DENOUNCES THE PHARISEES.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">11:14</sup>AND he cast out a
demon, and it was dumb. And when the demon had gone out, the dumb
spoke; and the multitudes wondered. <sup class="v">11:15</sup>But
some of them said, He casts out demons by Beelzebul, the ruler of
demons; <sup class="v">11:16</sup>and others, trying him, asked of
him a sign from heaven. <sup class="v">11:17</sup>But he, knowing
their thoughts, said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself
is desolated, and house falls upon house. <sup class=
"v">11:18</sup>And if Satan is divided against himself, how shall
his kingdom stand? because you say that I cast out demons by
Beelzebul. <sup class="v">11:19</sup>But if I by Beelzebul cast out
demons, by whom do your sons cast them out? they, therefore, shall
be your judges. <sup class="v">11:20</sup>But if by a finger of God
I cast out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
<sup class="v">11:21</sup>When a strong man armed keeps his court,
his goods are in peace; <sup class="v">11:22</sup>but when a
stronger man than he comes upon him, and overcomes him, he takes
away all his arms in which he trusted, and distributes his spoils.
<sup class="v">11:23</sup>He that is not with me is against me; and
he that gathers not with me scatters.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">11:24</sup>When an impure spirit
has gone out of a man, it passes through places destitute of water,
seeking a rest; and not finding one, says, I will return to my
house from which I came out. <sup class="v">11:25</sup>And coming,
it finds it swept and adorned. <sup class="v">11:26</sup>Then it
goes and takes seven other spirits more evil than itself; and they
come and dwell there; and the last condition of that man is worse
than the first.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">11:27</sup>And when he was saying
these things, a certain woman from the multitude lifted up her
voice, and said to him, Blessed is the mother that bore you, and
the breasts which you nursed! <sup class="v">11:28</sup>And he
said, Yes indeed, blessed are those that hear the word of God and
keep it.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">11:29</sup>And multitudes being
assembled, he said, This generation is an evil generation. It seeks
for a sign, and no sign shall be given it but the sign of Jonah.
<sup class="v">11:30</sup>For as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites,
so also shall the Son of man be to this generation. <sup class=
"v">11:31</sup>The queen of the south shall rise in the judgment
with the men of this generation and condemn them; for she came from
the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, a
greater than Solomon is here. <sup class="v">11:32</sup>The men of
Nineveh shall arise in the judgment with this generation and
condemn it; for they changed their minds at the preaching of Jonah,
and behold, a greater than Jonah is here.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">11:33</sup>No one lights a candle
and puts it in a secret place, or under a modius [1.916 gallon
measure], but on a candlestick, that all who go in may see the
light. <sup class="v">11:34</sup>The light of the body is the eye;
when, therefore, your eye is sound, your whole body is light; but
when your eye is evil, your whole body is dark. <sup class=
"v">11:35</sup>See, therefore, that the light which is in you be
not darkness. <sup class="v">11:36</sup>If, therefore, your whole
body is light, not having any part dark, the whole will be light,
as when a candle lights you clearly.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">11:37</sup>And when he was
speaking, a certain Pharisee asked him to breakfast with him; and
he went in and immediately sat down. <sup class="v">11:38</sup>And
the Pharisee seeing him, wondered that he was not first baptized
before breakfast. <sup class="v">11:39</sup>And the Lord said to
him, Now you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and plate,
but your inside is full of plunder and wickedness. <sup class=
"v">11:40</sup>Senseless men! did not he that made the outside make
also the inside? <sup class="v">11:41</sup>But give the things
within in charity, and behold, all things are pure to you.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">11:42</sup>But woe to you,
Pharisees! for you tithe mint, and rue, and every kind of plant,
and omit justice and the love of God. These things you ought to do,
and not to omit those. <sup class="v">11:43</sup>Woe to you,
Pharisees! for you love the first seat in the synagogues, and
salutations in the markets. <sup class="v">11:44</sup>Woe to you!
for you are like concealed tombs; and men walk over them and know
it not.</p>
<p class="pin">8 <sup class="v">11:45</sup>And one of the lawyers
answered and said to him, Teacher, in saying these things you
reproach us also. <sup class="v">11:46</sup>And he said, Woe to
you, lawyers! for you load men with burdens difficult to be borne,
and you yourselves will not touch the burdens with one of your
fingers. <sup class="v">11:47</sup>Woe to you! for you build the
tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them; <sup class=
"v">11:48</sup>therefore you are witnesses, and approve the deed of
your fathers; for they killed them, and you build. <sup class=
"v">11:49</sup>Therefore also the wisdom of God said, I will send
them prophets and apostles, and some of them they shall kill and
persecute, <sup class="v">11:50</sup>that the blood of all the
prophets which has been poured out since the foundation of the
world may be required of this generation, <sup class=
"v">11:51</sup>from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zachariah,
who perished between the altar and the house. Yes, I tell you, it
shall be required of this generation. <sup class="v">11:52</sup>Woe
to you, lawyers! for you have taken away the key of knowledge; you
do not enter in yourselves, and you forbid those entering.</p>
<p class="pin">9 <sup class="v">11:53</sup>And when he had gone
out thence the scribes and Pharisees were extremely angry, and
questioned him on many subjects, <sup class="v">11:54</sup>watching
him, to catch something from his mouth.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST'S DOCTRINE OF HYPOCRISY, OF THE PROVIDENCE OF GOD, OF
WORLDLY CARES, AND OF THE TIMES.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">12:1</sup>AT that time, the
multitude being assembled by ten thousands, so that they trod one
on another, he said to his disciples, Beware, first, of the leaven
of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy; <sup class="v">12:2</sup>for
there is nothing concealed that shall not be revealed, nor hid that
shall not be known. <sup class="v">12:3</sup>Whatever, therefore,
you have said in the darkness, shall be heard in the light; and
what you have spoken to the ear in private rooms, shall be
proclaimed on the houses. <sup class="v">12:4</sup>And I tell you,
my friends, fear not those that kill the body, and after this have
[power] to do nothing more. <sup class="v">12:5</sup>But I will
show you whom to fear; Fear him, who after killing has power to
cast into hell; yes, I tell you, Fear him. <sup class=
"v">12:6</sup>Are not five sparrows sold for two assarions [3
cents], and one of them is not forgotten before God? <sup class=
"v">12:7</sup>But even the hairs of your head are all numbered.
Fear not, therefore, for you are of more value than many
sparrows.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">12:8</sup>And I tell you, that
whoever shall confess me before men, him will the Son of man
confess before the angels of God; <sup class="v">12:9</sup>but he
that has denied me before men, shall be denied before the angels of
God. <sup class="v">12:10</sup>And every one that speaks a word
against the Son of man shall have forgiveness; but he that
blasphemes against the Holy Spirit shall not be forgiven.
<sup class="v">12:11</sup>And when they bring you to the
synagogues, and powers, and authorities, be not anxious how you
shall defend yourselves, or what you shall say; <sup class=
"v">12:12</sup>for the Holy Spirit shall teach you in that hour
what you ought to say.</p>
<p class="pin"></p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">12:13</sup>And one of the
multitude said to him, Teacher, tell my brother to divide with me
the inheritance. <sup class="v">12:14</sup>And he said to him, Man,
who made me a judge or a divider over you? <sup class=
"v">12:15</sup>And he said to them, See, and beware of all
covetousness; for one's life depends not on the abundance of his
property. <sup class="v">12:16</sup>And he told them a parable,
saying, The farm of a certain rich man produced abundantly;
<sup class="v">12:17</sup>and he reasoned in himself, saying, What
shall I do, for I have no place where I shall bring together my
fruits? <sup class="v">12:18</sup>And he said, I will do this; I
will take down my storehouses and build greater; and there will I
bring together all my produce and my goods; <sup class=
"v">12:19</sup>and I will say to my soul, Soul, you have many goods
laid up for many years rest, eat, drink, and enjoy yourself.
<sup class="v">12:20</sup>But God said to him, Foolish man, this
night they shall require your soul from you; and who then will have
the goods which you have provided? <sup class="v">12:21</sup>So is
every one that lays up treasures for himself and is not rich in
God.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">12:22</sup>And he said to his
disciples, I tell you, therefore, be not anxious for your soul what
you shall eat, nor for the body what you shall put on. <sup class=
"v">12:23</sup>Is not the soul more than the food, and the body
than the clothing? <sup class="v">12:24</sup>Consider the ravens;
for they neither sow nor reap, and they have no private room, no
storehouse; and God feeds them. How much are you better than the
birds! <sup class="v">12:25</sup>And which of you can add a cubit
to his stature? <sup class="v">12:26</sup>And if you cannot do the
least, why are you anxious for the rest? <sup class=
"v">12:27</sup>Consider the lilies; how they neither spin nor
weave; but I tell you that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed
like one of them. <sup class="v">12:28</sup>And if God so clothes
the grass in the field, which to-day is, and to-morrow is cast into
the oven, will he not much more clothe you, men of little faith?
<sup class="v">12:29</sup>And seek not what you shall eat, and what
you shall drink, and be not of a doubtful mind; <sup class=
"v">12:30</sup>for all these things do the nations of the world
seek; and your Father knows that you need them. <sup class=
"v">12:31</sup>But seek his kingdom, and these shall be added to
you. <sup class="v">12:32</sup>Fear not, little flock, for your
Father is well pleased to give you the kingdom. <sup class=
"v">12:33</sup>Sell your property and bestow charity; make
yourselves purses that become not old, and a treasury that fails
not, in heaven, where no thief approaches, nor moth destroys;
<sup class="v">12:34</sup>for where your treasury is, there will
your heart be also.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">12:35</sup>Stand with your loins
girded, and your candles lighted, <sup class="v">12:36</sup>and be
like men waiting for the coming of their lord, when he shall return
from the wedding, that when he comes and knocks they may open to
him immediately. <sup class="v">12:37</sup>Blessed are those
servants whom their lord when he comes shall find watching. I tell
you truly, that he will gird himself, and cause them to recline,
and he will come and wait upon them. <sup class="v">12:38</sup>And
if he comes in the second watch, and comes in the third watch, and
finds them thus, blessed are they. <sup class="v">12:39</sup>But
know this, that if the householder had known at what hour the thief
comes, he would have watched, and not have suffered his house to be
broken through. <sup class="v">12:40</sup>Be you also ready; for in
an hour when you think not the Son of man comes.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">12:41</sup>And Peter said to him,
Lord, do you speak this parable to us, or also to all? <sup class=
"v">12:42</sup>And the Lord said, Who then is a faithful, a wise
steward, whom the lord shall place over his family, to give them
their proper food in due time? <sup class="v">12:43</sup>Blessed is
that servant whom his lord when he comes shall find so doing.
<sup class="v">12:44</sup>I tell you truly, that he will set him
over all his property. <sup class="v">12:45</sup>But if that
servant says in his heart, My lord delays to come, and begins to
beat the younger servants, and female servants, and to eat and
drink and be drunk, <sup class="v">12:46</sup>the lord of that
servant will come in a day that he looks not for him, and at an
hour that he knows not of, and will punish him severely, and give
him his part with the faithless. <sup class="v">12:47</sup>And that
servant who knew his lord's will and prepared not himself, nor did
according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes;
<sup class="v">12:48</sup>but he that knew not, and did things
worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few. And from any one to
whom much is given, much will be demanded; and of him with whom men
have deposited much, they will ask more.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">12:49</sup>I have come to send a
fire on the earth; and what will I if it is already kindled?
<sup class="v">12:50</sup>But I have a baptism to be baptized with;
and how am I straitened till it is fully accomplished! <sup class=
"v">12:51</sup>Do you think that I have come to give peace on the
earth? I tell you, no; but rather division. <sup class=
"v">12:52</sup>For from this time there shall be five in one house
divided, three against two, and two shall be divided against three;
<sup class="v">12:53</sup>a father against a son, and a son against
a father; a mother against the daughter, and a daughter against the
mother; a mother-in-law against the daughter-in-law, and a
daughter-in-law against the mother-in-law.</p>
<p class="pin">8 <sup class="v">12:54</sup>And he also said to
the multitudes, When you see a cloud rise in the west you
immediately say, There comes a shower; and it is so. <sup class=
"v">12:55</sup>And when the south wind blows you say, There will be
heat; and there is. <sup class="v">12:56</sup>Hypocrites! You know
how to distinguish the appearance of the earth and sky, and how do
you not distinguish this time? <sup class="v">12:57</sup>And why
even of yourselves do you not judge what is right? <sup class=
"v">12:58</sup>For when you go with your adversary to a ruler, on
the way labor to be released from him, lest he take you to the
judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and the officer
cast you into prison; <sup class="v">12:59</sup>I tell you that you
shall not go out thence till you have paid even the last lepton [2
mill].</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST COMMENTING ON THE SLAUGHTER OF CERTAIN GALILEANS, CURING
A DEMONIAC ON THE SABBATH, THE SAVED, ETC.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">13:1</sup>AND some were present
at that time, telling him of the Galileans whose blood Pilate
mingled with their sacrifices. <sup class="v">13:2</sup>And he
answered and said to them, Do you think those Galileans were
sinners above all the Galileans, because they suffered such things?
<sup class="v">13:3</sup>I tell you, No; but unless you change your
minds you shall all in like manner be destroyed. <sup class=
"v">13:4</sup>Or those eighteen on whom the tower in the Siloam
fell, and killed them; do you think they were sinners above all men
that live at Jerusalem? <sup class="v">13:5</sup>I tell you, No;
but unless you change your minds you shall all in like manner be
destroyed.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">13:6</sup>And he spoke this
parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and
he came seeking fruit on it and found none. <sup class=
"v">13:7</sup>And he said to his vine dresser, Behold, I have come
three years seeking fruit on this fig tree and find none; cut it
down; why should it make the ground unproductive? <sup class=
"v">13:8</sup>And he answered and said to him, Lord, let it alone
this year also, till I dig about it, and put on manure; <sup class=
"v">13:9</sup>and if it bears fruit, well; but if not, at a future
time you shall cut it down.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">13:10</sup>And he was teaching in
one of the synagogues on the sabbath, <sup class="v">13:11</sup>and
behold, there was a woman who had been subject to a spirit of
infirmity eighteen years, and was bent down, and was not able to
lift herself up at all. <sup class="v">13:12</sup>And Jesus seeing
her, called to her and said, Woman, you are released from your
infirmity; <sup class="v">13:13</sup>and he put his hands on her,
and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God.
<sup class="v">13:14</sup>And the synagogue ruler answered, being
angry because Jesus had performed a cure on the sabbath, and said
to the multitude, There are six days in which you ought to work; in
them, therefore, come and be cured, and not on the sabbath.
<sup class="v">13:15</sup>Then the Lord answered him and said,
Hypocrites, does not each of you on the sabbath untie his ox or his
ass from the manger, and lead him away to drink? <sup class=
"v">13:16</sup>And ought not this woman, being a daughter of
Abraham, whom Satan has bound, behold, eighteen years, to be
released from this bond on the sabbath? <sup class=
"v">13:17</sup>And when he had said these things all his enemies
were ashamed; and all the people rejoiced on account of all the
glorious works performed by him.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">13:18</sup>And he said, What is
the kingdom of God like? and to what shall I liken it? <sup class=
"v">13:19</sup>It is like a mustard seed which a man took and cast
into his garden; and it grew and became a great tree, and the birds
of heaven lodged in its branches. <sup class="v">13:20</sup>Again
he said, To what shall I liken the kingdom of God? <sup class=
"v">13:21</sup>It is like leaven which a woman took and hid in
three sata [33 quarts] of flour, till the whole was leavened.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">13:22</sup>And he went through
the cities and villages teaching, and making his way towards
Jerusalem. <sup class="v">13:23</sup>And some one said to him,
Lord, are there few who are saved? And he said to them, <sup class=
"v">13:24</sup>Strive to enter in by the narrow gate; for many, I
tell you, shall seek to enter in, and shall not be able.
<sup class="v">13:25</sup>When the householder has risen and shut
the door, and you stand without and knock at the door, saying,
Lord, open to us, and he will answer and say to you, I know you not
whence you are, <sup class="v">13:26</sup>then you will say, We eat
and drank in your presence, and you have taught in our streets;
<sup class="v">13:27</sup>and he will say to you, I know not whence
you are; depart from me, all doers of wickedness. <sup class=
"v">13:28</sup>There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when
you shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets
in the kingdom of God, and you cast out. <sup class=
"v">13:29</sup>And they shall come from the east and west, and from
the north and south, and shall recline in the kingdom of God.
<sup class="v">13:30</sup>And behold, there are last who shall be
first, and there are first who shall be last.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">13:31</sup>On the same day some
of the Pharisees came to him, saying, Go out and depart hence, for
Herod wishes to kill you. <sup class="v">13:32</sup>And he said to
them, Go and tell that fox, Behold, I cast out demons, and finish
[performing] cures to-day and to-morrow, and on the third day I
shall finish my course. <sup class="v">13:33</sup>But I must go on
to-day and to-morrow, and the day following; for it is not possible
for a prophet to be destroyed out of Jerusalem. <sup class=
"v">13:34</sup>Jerusalem, Jerusalem, killing the prophets and
stoning those sent to her, how often would I have gathered your
children together, as a bird gathers her young under her wings, and
you would not! <sup class="v">13:35</sup>Behold, your house is left
to you. And I tell you, that you shall not see me, till [the day]
shall come when you shall say, Blessed is he that comes in the name
of the Lord.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST DINING WITH A RULER ON THE SABBATH, THE PARABLE OF THE
GREAT SUPPER, QUALIFICATIONS FOR DISCIPLESHIP.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">14:1</sup>AND he came into the
house of one of the rulers of the Pharisees to eat bread on the
sabbath; and they watched him closely. <sup class="v">14:2</sup>And
behold, there was a man before him having the dropsy. <sup class=
"v">14:3</sup>And Jesus answered and said to the lawyers and
Pharisees, Is it lawful to cure on the sabbath, or not? <sup class=
"v">14:4</sup>And they were silent. And he took and cured him, and
dismissed him. <sup class="v">14:5</sup>And he answered and said to
them, If a son or an ox of any of you shall fall into a pit, will
he not immediately take him out on the sabbath day? <sup class=
"v">14:6</sup>And they could not answer to these things.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">14:7</sup>And he spoke a parable
to the invited, when he observed how they selected the first places
at the table; saying to them, <sup class="v">14:8</sup>When you are
invited by any one to a wedding, do not sit down in the first
place, lest at some time a more honorable man than you should have
been invited by him, <sup class="v">14:9</sup>and he that invited
you and him come and say to you, Give this man a place; and then
with shame you take the last place. <sup class="v">14:10</sup>But
when you are invited, go and sit down in the last place, that when
he who invited you comes, he may say to you, Friend, go up higher;
then you shall have honor in the presence of those that recline
with you; <sup class="v">14:11</sup>for every one that exalts
himself shall be humbled, and he that humbles himself shall be
exalted.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">14:12</sup>And he said also to
him that had invited him, When you make a breakfast, or a supper,
call not your friends, nor your brothers, nor your relatives, nor
your rich neighbors, lest they also at some time invite you in
return, and a compensation be made to you. <sup class=
"v">14:13</sup>But when you make a feast, invite the poor,
crippled, lame, blind, <sup class="v">14:14</sup>and you shall be
blessed; for they cannot compensate you; for you shall be
compensated at the resurrection of the just.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">14:15</sup>And one of those
reclining with him, hearing these things, said to him, Blessed is
he that eats bread in the kingdom of God. <sup class=
"v">14:16</sup>And he said to him, A certain man made a great
supper, and invited many. <sup class="v">14:17</sup>And he sent his
servant at the time of the supper to say to the invited, Come, for
all things are now ready. <sup class="v">14:18</sup>And they all
with one consent excused themselves. The first said to him, I have
bought a field and I must go to see it; I pray you have me excused.
<sup class="v">14:19</sup>And another said, I have bought five
yokes of oxen and I go to try them; I pray you have me excused.
<sup class="v">14:20</sup>And another said, I have married a wife,
and on this account I cannot come. <sup class="v">14:21</sup>And
the servant came and reported to his lord these things. Then the
master of the house; being angry, said to his servant, Go out
quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither
the poor, and maimed, and blind, and lame. <sup class=
"v">14:22</sup>And the servant said, Lord, it is done as you
commanded, and yet there is room. <sup class="v">14:23</sup>And the
Lord said to the servant, Go out into the ways and along the
hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled;
<sup class="v">14:24</sup>for I tell you that none of those men
that were invited shall taste of my supper.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">14:25</sup>And great multitudes
were travelling with him; and turning around he said to them,
<sup class="v">14:26</sup>If any one comes to me, and hates not his
father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brothers, and
sisters, and still more his own life also, he cannot be my
disciple. <sup class="v">14:27</sup>And whoever does not bear his
cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple. <sup class=
"v">14:28</sup>For what man of you wishing to build a tower, does
not first sit down and estimate the expense, whether he has the
means to finish? <sup class="v">14:29</sup>lest having laid its
foundation, and not being able to finish, all who see ridicule him,
<sup class="v">14:30</sup>saying, This man began to build and was
not able to finish. <sup class="v">14:31</sup>Or what king going to
engage in war with another king, does not first sit down and
consult whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him that comes
against him with twenty thousand? <sup class="v">14:32</sup>And if
not, while he is yet a great way off, sending an embassy he desires
conditions of peace. <sup class="v">14:33</sup>So, therefore, no
one of you can be my disciple who does not forsake all that he has.
<sup class="v">14:34</sup>Salt, therefore, is good; but if the salt
has lost its strength, with what shall it be seasoned? <sup class=
"v">14:35</sup>It is not fit for land, nor for manure; they cast it
away. He that has ears to hear, let him hear.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2>
<h3>PARABLES OF THE LOST SHEEP, THE LOST MONEY, AND THE PRODIGAL
SON.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">15:1</sup>AND all the publicans
and sinners came near him to hear him. <sup class="v">15:2</sup>And
both the Pharisees and scribes complained, saying, This man
receives sinners and eats with them. <sup class="v">15:3</sup>And
he spoke to them this parable; saying, <sup class=
"v">15:4</sup>What man of you having a hundred sheep, and losing
one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness, and
go after the lost sheep till he finds it. <sup class=
"v">15:5</sup>And finding it, he puts it on his shoulders
rejoicing; <sup class="v">15:6</sup>and coming to the house, he
calls together his friends and neighbors, saying, Congratulate me;
for I have found my sheep that was lost. <sup class=
"v">15:7</sup>So, I tell you, there shall be joy in heaven over one
sinner that changes his mind, more than over ninety-nine righteous
persons who do not need a change of mind.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">15:8</sup>Or what woman having
ten drachmas [140 cents], if she loses one drachma [14 cents], does
not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek carefully till
she finds it? <sup class="v">15:9</sup>And when she finds it, she
calls her female friends and neighbors together, saying,
Congratulate me, for I have found the drachma which I lost.
<sup class="v">15:10</sup>So, I tell you, there is joy before the
angels of God over one sinner that changes his mind.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">15:11</sup>And he said, A certain
man had two sons. <sup class="v">15:12</sup>And the youngest of
them said to the father, Father, give me the portion of the estate
that falls to me; and he divided to them his living. <sup class=
"v">15:13</sup>And not many days after, the youngest son,
collecting all his property, went abroad to a distant country; and
there wasted his property, living intemperately. <sup class=
"v">15:14</sup>And when he had spent all, there was a severe famine
in that country; and he began to be in want. <sup class=
"v">15:15</sup>And he went and attached himself to one of the
citizens of that country; and he sent him into his field to feed
swine. <sup class="v">15:16</sup>And he desired to fill his stomach
with the carob pods which the swine eat; and no man gave him.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">15:17</sup>And coming to himself,
he said, How many hired servants of my father abound in bread, but
I perish here with hunger! <sup class="v">15:18</sup>I will arise
and go to my father, and say to him, Father, I have sinned to
Heaven, and before you; <sup class="v">15:19</sup>I am no longer
worthy to be called your son; make me as one of your hired
servants. <sup class="v">15:20</sup>And he arose, and came to his
father. But while he was yet far off, his father saw him, and had
compassion on him, and ran and fell on his neck, and kissed him.
<sup class="v">15:21</sup>And the son said to him, Father, I have
sinned to Heaven, and before you; I am no longer worthy to be
called your son. <sup class="v">15:22</sup>But the father said to
his servants, Bring out the best robe and put on him; and put a
ring on his hand, and sandals on his feet; <sup class=
"v">15:23</sup>and bring the fatted calf and kill it; let us eat,
and rejoice; <sup class="v">15:24</sup>for this my son was dead,
and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to
rejoice.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">15:25</sup>But his older son was
in the field; and when he came and approached the house he heard
music and the dancers. <sup class="v">15:26</sup>And calling one of
the servants he inquired what these things meant. <sup class=
"v">15:27</sup>And he said to him, Your brother has come; and your
father has killed the fatted calf, because he has received him back
in health. <sup class="v">15:28</sup>And he was angry, and would
not go in; but his father came out and entreated him. <sup class=
"v">15:29</sup>And he answered and said to his father, Behold, I
have served you so many years, and have never disobeyed your
command; and you have never given me a kid, that I might rejoice
with my friends; <sup class="v">15:30</sup>but when this your son
came who has consumed his living with harlots, you killed for him
the fatted calf. <sup class="v">15:31</sup>But he said to him, Son,
you are always with me, and all mine is yours. <sup class=
"v">15:32</sup>We ought also to rejoice and be glad; for this your
brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is
found.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>
<h3>THE UNFAITHFUL STEWARD, AND THE RICH MAN AND LAZARUS.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">16:1</sup>AND he also said to the
disciples, There was a certain rich man that had a steward; and he
was accused to him of wasting his property. <sup class=
"v">16:2</sup>And calling him, he said to him, What is this which I
hear of you? Render an account of your stewardship; for you can be
no longer a steward. <sup class="v">16:3</sup>And the steward said
within himself, What shall I do, because my lord takes the
stewardship away from me? I am not strong enough to dig; I am
ashamed to beg. <sup class="v">16:4</sup>I know what I will do,
that when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into
their houses. <sup class="v">16:5</sup>And calling each one of his
lord's debtors, he said to the first, How much do you owe my lord?
<sup class="v">16:6</sup>And he said, A hundred baths [1,350
gallons] of oil. And he said to him, Take your bill, and sit down
quickly, and write fifty. <sup class="v">16:7</sup>Then he said to
another, And how much do you owe? And he said, A hundred cors
[1,445 bushels] of wheat. And he said to him, Take your bill, and
write eighty. <sup class="v">16:8</sup>And the lord praised the
unjust steward, because he did wisely; for the children of this
life are wiser, for their generation, than the children of
light.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">16:9</sup>And I tell you, Make
yourselves friends of the riches procured by injustice, that when
it fails they may receive you into the eternal tabernacles.
<sup class="v">16:10</sup>He that is faithful in the least is
faithful also in much; and he that is unjust in the least is unjust
also in much. <sup class="v">16:11</sup>If, therefore, you have not
been faithful in the riches procured by injustice, who will commit
to you the true? <sup class="v">16:12</sup>And if you have not been
faithful in another's, who will give you yours? <sup class=
"v">16:13</sup>No domestic can serve two masters; for he will
either hate the first and love the other, or he will adhere to the
first and despise the other. You cannot serve God and riches.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">16:14</sup>And the Pharisees, who
are avaricious, heard all these things, and derided him.
<sup class="v">16:15</sup>And he said to them, You are they that
justify yourselves before men; but God knows your hearts; for that
which is high among men is an abomination before God. <sup class=
"v">16:16</sup>The law and the prophets were till John; since that
time the kingdom of God is preached, and every one presses
violently into it. <sup class="v">16:17</sup>And it is easier for
heaven and earth to pass away, than for one point of the law to
fail. <sup class="v">16:18</sup>Every one that puts away his wife
and marries another, commits adultery; and he that marries a woman
put away from a husband, commits adultery.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">16:19</sup>There was a certain
rich man, and he was clothed in purple and fine linen, and feasted
sumptuously every day. <sup class="v">16:20</sup>And a certain poor
man by the name of Lazarus was laid at his gate, afflicted with
ulcers, <sup class="v">16:21</sup>and desiring to be fed with the
crumbs which fell from the rich man's table; but the dogs also came
and licked his ulcers. <sup class="v">16:22</sup>And the poor man
died, and was carried away by the angels to Abraham's bosom. And
the rich man also died, and was buried; <sup class=
"v">16:23</sup>and in hades he lifted up his eyes, being in
torments, and saw Abraham from afar, and Lazarus in his bosom.
<sup class="v">16:24</sup>And he called and said, Father Abraham,
have mercy on me, and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in
water and cool my tongue; for I am in pain in this flame.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">16:25</sup>But Abraham said, Son,
remember that you received your good things in your life, and
Lazarus in like manner evil things; but now he is comforted here,
and you are in pain. <sup class="v">16:26</sup>And besides all
this, there is a great chasm fixed between us and you, so that
those wishing to pass from hence to you cannot, neither can they
pass from thence to us. <sup class="v">16:27</sup>And he said, I
beseech you then, father, send him to my father's house,
<sup class="v">16:28</sup>for I have five brothers, to testify
fully to them, that they may not also come to this place of torment
<sup class="v">16:29</sup>But Abraham said, They have Moses and the
prophets; let them hear them. <sup class="v">16:30</sup>But he
said, No, father Abraham, but if one went to them from the dead
they would change their minds. <sup class="v">16:31</sup>But he
said to him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, they would
not be persuaded if one arose from the dead.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST'S DOCTRINE RESPECTING OFFENSES, CURING TEN LEPERS, AND
PREDICTING THE COMING OF HIS KINGDOM.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">17:1</sup>AND he said to his
disciples, It is inevitable that offenses should come; but woe to
him by whom they come; <sup class="v">17:2</sup>it would be
profitable for him if a millstone was placed around his neck, and
he was cast into the sea, rather than that he should offend one of
these little ones. <sup class="v">17:3</sup>Take heed to
yourselves; if your brother sins, reprove him; and if he changes
his mind, forgive him; <sup class="v">17:4</sup>and if he sins
against you seven times in a day, and turn seven times, saying, I
change my mind, you shall forgive him.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">17:5</sup>And the apostles said
to the Lord, Increase our faith. <sup class="v">17:6</sup>And the
Lord said, If you had a faith like a mustard seed, you would say to
this sycamore tree, Be taken up by the roots and planted in the
sea, and it would obey you. <sup class="v">17:7</sup>But which of
you having a servant plowing, or keeping sheep, will say to him
when he comes in from the field, Come immediately and sit down?
<sup class="v">17:8</sup>but will he not say to him, Prepare
something that I may take supper, and gird yourself and wait on me
till I eat and drink, and after that do you eat and drink?
<sup class="v">17:9</sup>Does he thank the servant because he did
the things commanded him? <sup class="v">17:10</sup>So also you,
when you have done all things commanded you, say, We are
unprofitable servants; what we owed the doing of; we have done.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">17:11</sup>And he was going to
Jerusalem, and he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.
<sup class="v">17:12</sup>And coming to a certain village, ten
lepers met him, who stood afar off. <sup class="v">17:13</sup>And
they lifted up their voice saying, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.
<sup class="v">17:14</sup>And seeing them, he said, Go and show
yourselves to the priests. And as they were going they were
cleansed. <sup class="v">17:15</sup>And one of them seeing that he
was cured, returned, glorifying God with a loud voice, <sup class=
"v">17:16</sup>and fell on his face at his feet and thanked him.
And he was a Samaritan. <sup class="v">17:17</sup>And Jesus
answered and said to him, Were there not ten cleansed? but where
are the nine? <sup class="v">17:18</sup>There are not found
returning to give glory to God any but this stranger. <sup class=
"v">17:19</sup>And he said to him, Arise and go; your faith has
cured you.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">17:20</sup>And being asked by the
Pharisees when the kingdom of God comes, he answered them and said,
The kingdom of God comes not with observation; <sup class=
"v">17:21</sup>neither shall they say, Behold here! or, there! for
behold, the kingdom of God is within you. <sup class=
"v">17:22</sup>And he said to the disciples, The days will come
when you shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and
shall not see it. <sup class="v">17:23</sup>And they shall say to
you, Behold there! behold here! go not away, nor follow them.
<sup class="v">17:24</sup>For as the lightning flashing from one
part under heaven shines to another part under heaven, so shall the
Son of man be in his day. <sup class="v">17:25</sup>But first he
must suffer many things, and be rejected by this generation.
<sup class="v">17:26</sup>And as it was in the days of Noah, so
shall it be also in the days of the Son of man. <sup class=
"v">17:27</sup>They eat, they drank, they married, they were
married, till the day that Noah entered into the ark, and the flood
came and destroyed all. <sup class="v">17:28</sup>In like manner
also as it was in the days of Lot; they eat, drank, bought, sold,
planted, built; <sup class="v">17:29</sup>but on the day that Lot
went out of Sodom it rained fire and sulphur from heaven, and
destroyed all; <sup class="v">17:30</sup>so shall it be in the day
when the Son of man is revealed.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">17:31</sup>In that day let not
him that shall be on the house, and his furniture in the house,
come down to take it away; and in like manner let not him in the
field turn back for things which are behind; <sup class=
"v">17:32</sup>remember Lot's wife. <sup class=
"v">17:33</sup>Whoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it;
and whoever shall lose shall save it. <sup class="v">17:34</sup>I
tell you, on that night two shall be on one bed; one shall be taken
and the other left; <sup class="v">17:35</sup>two shall be grinding
together; one shall be taken and the other left. <sup class=
"v">17:37</sup>And they answered and said to him, Where, Lord? And
he said to them, Where the body is, there will the eagles be
gathered together.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>
<h3>THE PARABLE OF THE UNJUST JUDGE, INFANTS, AND THE WAY OF
SALVATION.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">18:1</sup>AND he spoke also a
parable to them, that men ought to pray at all times, and not to
faint; <sup class="v">18:2</sup>saying, There was a certain judge
in a certain city, who feared not God and regarded not man.
<sup class="v">18:3</sup>And there was a widow in that city, and
she came to him, saying, Give me judgment against my adversary.
<sup class="v">18:4</sup>And he would not for a time; but
afterwards he said within himself, Though I fear not God and regard
not man, <sup class="v">18:5</sup>yet because this widow makes me
trouble I will give her judgment, that she may not vex me by her
continual coming. <sup class="v">18:6</sup>And the Lord said, Hear
what the unjust judge says. <sup class="v">18:7</sup>And will not
God execute the judgment of his elect, who cry day and night to
him, even though he waits long on them? <sup class="v">18:8</sup>I
tell you, he will execute their judgment speedily. But when the Son
of man comes will he find faith on the earth?</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">18:9</sup>And he also spoke this
parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous,
and despised others: <sup class="v">18:10</sup>Two men went up to
the temple to pray; one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.
<sup class="v">18:11</sup>The Pharisee, standing by himself,
offered this prayer; God, I thank thee that I am not as other men,
rapacious, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican;
<sup class="v">18:12</sup>I fast twice a week; I tithe all I
acquire. <sup class="v">18:13</sup>And the publican, standing afar
off, would not lift up his eyes to heaven, but smote on his breast,
saying, God, be propitious to me a sinner. <sup class=
"v">18:14</sup>I tell you this man went down to his house justified
rather than that; for every one that exalts himself shall be
humbled, and he that humbles himself shall be exalted.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">18:15</sup>And they brought him
also infants, that he should touch them; and the disciples seeing
it reproved them. <sup class="v">18:16</sup>But Jesus calling them,
said, Suffer the little children to come to me, and forbid them
not; for of such is the kingdom of God. <sup class="v">18:17</sup>I
tell you truly, that whoever receives not the kingdom of God as a
little child, shall by no means enter into it.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">18:18</sup>And a certain ruler
asked him, saying, Good teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal
life? <sup class="v">18:19</sup>And Jesus said to him, Why do you
call me good? There is none good but one, God. <sup class=
"v">18:20</sup>You know the commandments; You shall not commit
adultery, You shall not kill, You shall not steal, You shall not
testify falsely, Honor your father and your mother. <sup class=
"v">18:21</sup>And he said, All these have I kept from my youth.
<sup class="v">18:22</sup>And Jesus hearing it, said to him, One
thing you yet want; sell all that you have, and distribute to the
poor, and you shall have a treasure in heaven, and come, follow me.
<sup class="v">18:23</sup>And when he heard these things he was
sad; for he was very rich. <sup class="v">18:24</sup>And Jesus
seeing him, said, With what difficulty do those who have riches
enter into the kingdom of God! <sup class="v">18:25</sup>It is
easier for a camel to enter through the eye of a needle, than for a
rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. <sup class=
"v">18:26</sup>And those hearing him, said, And who can be saved?
<sup class="v">18:27</sup>And he said, Things impossible with man
are possible with God.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">18:28</sup>And Peter said,
Behold, we have left our [property] and followed you. <sup class=
"v">18:29</sup>And he said to them, I tell you truly, that there is
no one who has left a house, or wife, or brothers, or parents, or
children, on account of the kingdom of God, <sup class=
"v">18:30</sup>who shall not receive manifold more in this time,
and in the life to come eternal life.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST PREDICTING HIS DEATH, GIVING SIGHT TO A BLIND MAN,
STOPPING WITH ZACCHEUS, AND THE PARABLE OF THE NOBLEMAN RECEIVING A
KINGDOM.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">18:31</sup>AND Jesus took the
twelve aside, and said to them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and
all things written by the prophets concerning the Son of man will
be finished. <sup class="v">18:32</sup>For he will be delivered to
the Gentiles, and be mocked, and injuriously treated, and spit
upon, <sup class="v">18:33</sup>and they will scourge and kill him,
and on the third day he will rise again. <sup class=
"v">18:34</sup>And they understood nothing of these things; and
this word was concealed from them, and they did not perceive what
was said.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">18:35</sup>And when they came
nigh to Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way, begging.
<sup class="v">18:36</sup>And hearing the multitude passing by he
inquired what it meant. <sup class="v">18:37</sup>And they told
him, Jesus the Nazoraean is passing by. <sup class=
"v">18:38</sup>And he cried, saying, Jesus, Son of David, have
mercy on me. <sup class="v">18:39</sup>And those going before
charged him to be still; but he cried much more, Son of David, have
mercy on me. <sup class="v">18:40</sup>And Jesus stopping,
commanded him to be brought to him. And when he came near he asked
him, <sup class="v">18:41</sup>saying, What do you wish me to do
for you? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight.
<sup class="v">18:42</sup>And Jesus said to him, Receive your
sight; your faith has cured you. <sup class="v">18:43</sup>And he
immediately received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God;
and all the people seeing it gave praise to God.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">19:1</sup>And entering into
Jericho he passed through it. <sup class="v">19:2</sup>And behold,
there was a man called Zaccheus, and he was chief publican, and was
rich. <sup class="v">19:3</sup>And he sought to see Jesus, who he
was; and could not on account of the multitude, because he was of
small stature. <sup class="v">19:4</sup>And running before, he went
up on a sycamore that he might see him; for he was to pass by it.
<sup class="v">19:5</sup>And when he came to the place, Jesus
looking up saw him, and said to him, Zaccheus, make haste and come
down, for to-day I must stop at your house; <sup class=
"v">19:6</sup>and he made haste and came down, and received him
rejoicing. <sup class="v">19:7</sup>And seeing it, they all
complained, saying, He has gone in to stop with a sinner.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">19:8</sup>And Zaccheus stood up
and said to the Lord, Behold, half of my property, Lord, I give to
the poor; and if I have defrauded any one of any thing, I restore
fourfold. <sup class="v">19:9</sup>And Jesus said to him, To-day
has salvation come to this house, because he also is a son of
Abraham; <sup class="v">19:10</sup>for the Son of man has come to
seek and save the lost.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">19:11</sup>And when they were
hearing these things, he added and spoke a parable, because he was
nigh Jerusalem; and they thought that the kingdom of God was
immediately to appear. <sup class="v">19:12</sup>He said,
therefore, A certain nobleman went into a distant country to
receive a kingdom for himself, and to return. <sup class=
"v">19:13</sup>And calling his ten servants, he gave them ten minas
[$163.30], and said to them, Use them in business till I come.
<sup class="v">19:14</sup>And his citizens hated him, and sent an
embassy after him, saying, We wish not this man to reign over us.
<sup class="v">19:15</sup>And he returned, having received the
kingdom, and ordered those servants to be called to him to whom he
had given the money, that he might know what each one had done.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">19:16</sup>And the first came,
saying, Lord, your mina [$16.33] has gained ten minas. <sup class=
"v">19:17</sup>And he said to him, Well, good servant; because you
have been faithful in the least, have authority over ten cities.
<sup class="v">19:18</sup>And the second came, saying, Lord, your
mina has made five minas. <sup class="v">19:19</sup>And he said to
him, Be you over five cities. <sup class="v">19:20</sup>And the
other came, saying, Lord, behold your mina, which I had laid up in
a napkin; <sup class="v">19:21</sup>for I feared you, because you
are an austere man; you take up what you laid not down, and reap
what you did not sow. <sup class="v">19:22</sup>He said to him, Out
of your mouth will I judge you, evil servant. You knew that I am an
austere man, taking up what I laid not down, and reaping what I did
not sow? <sup class="v">19:23</sup>then why did you not put my
silver on the [broker's] table, and when I came I should have had
the same, with interest? <sup class="v">19:24</sup>And he said to
those standing by, Take from him the mina, and give it to him that
has ten minas,&mdash; <sup class="v">19:25</sup>and they said to
him, Lord, he has ten minas,&mdash; <sup class="v">19:26</sup>for I
tell you, that to every one that has shall be given; but from him
that has not, even what he has shall be taken away; <sup class=
"v">19:27</sup>but those my enemies that wished me not to reign
over them, bring hither and kill them before me.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST ENTERING JERUSALEM, AND PURIFYING THE TEMPLE.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">19:28</sup>AND having said these
things he went forward going up to Jerusalem. <sup class=
"v">19:29</sup>And when he came near to Bethphage and Bethany, at
the mountain called the Mount of Olives, he sent two of the
disciples, <sup class="v">19:30</sup>saying, Go into the village
opposite to you, and having entered into it you will find a colt
tied, on which no man ever sat; untie and bring him; <sup class=
"v">19:31</sup>and if any one asks you, Why do you untie him? Say
thus to him; The Lord has need of him. <sup class=
"v">19:32</sup>And those sent, going, found as he said to them.
<sup class="v">19:33</sup>And untying the colt, his owners said to
them, Why do you untie the colt? <sup class="v">19:34</sup>And they
said, The Lord has need of him. <sup class="v">19:35</sup>And they
brought him to Jesus; and spreading their clothes on the colt they
put Jesus on him. <sup class="v">19:36</sup>And as he proceeded
they spread their clothes in the way. <sup class="v">19:37</sup>And
when he was now approaching, at the descent of the Mount of Olives,
all the multitude of the disciples began to rejoice, and praise God
with a loud voice for all the mighty works which they saw,
<sup class="v">19:38</sup>saying, Blessed is the king who comes in
the name of the Lord; peace be in heaven, and glory in the highest
[heavens]. <sup class="v">19:39</sup>And some of the Pharisees,
from the multitude, said to him, Teacher, rebuke your disciples.
<sup class="v">19:40</sup>And he answered and said to them, I tell
you that if these should be silent the stones would cry out.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">19:41</sup>And when he came near
and saw the city he wept over it, <sup class="v">19:42</sup>saying,
O, that you had known, even you, and indeed in this your day, the
things which are for your peace! But now they are hid from your
eyes. <sup class="v">19:43</sup>For days of [trouble] will come
upon you, and your enemies shall throw an embankment around you,
and shut you in, and press you on every side, <sup class=
"v">19:44</sup>and destroy you and your children with you, and not
leave stone upon stone in you; because you knew not the time of
your visitation.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">19:45</sup>And going into the
temple he cast out those that sold, <sup class=
"v">19:46</sup>saying to them, it is written, My house shall be a
house of prayer; but you have made it a den of robbers.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST IN THE TEMPLE REPLYING TO THE PHARISEES AND
SADDUCEES.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">19:47</sup>AND he taught daily in
the temple; and the chief priests, and scribes, and the first of
the people sought to destroy him. <sup class="v">19:48</sup>And
they found nothing that they could do; for all the people were
attentive to hear him. <sup class="v">20:1</sup>And on one of those
days, as he was teaching the people in the temple, and proclaiming
the good news, the chief priests and scribes, with the elders, came
upon him, <sup class="v">20:2</sup>and spoke to him saying, Tell us
by what authority you do these things? and who gave you this
authority? <sup class="v">20:3</sup>And he answered and said to
them, I also will ask you a question; and tell me, <sup class=
"v">20:4</sup>Was the baptism of John from heaven, or from men?
<sup class="v">20:5</sup>And they reasoned with themselves, saying,
If we say, From heaven, he will say, Why did you not believe him?
<sup class="v">20:6</sup>But if we say, From men, all the people
will stone us; for they are persuaded that John is a prophet.
<sup class="v">20:7</sup>And they answered, They did not know
whence. <sup class="v">20:8</sup>And Jesus said to them, Neither do
I tell you by what authority I do these things.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">20:9</sup>And he spoke to the
people this parable; A man planted a vineyard, and let it out to
husbandmen, and went abroad for a long time. <sup class=
"v">20:10</sup>And at the time he sent to the husbandmen a servant,
that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard; and the
husbandmen beat him, and sent him away empty. <sup class=
"v">20:11</sup>And again he sent another servant; and they beat
him, and treated him shamefully, and sent him away empty.
<sup class="v">20:12</sup>And again he sent a third; and they
wounded him, and cast him out. <sup class="v">20:13</sup>And the
lord of the vineyard said, What shall I do? I will send my beloved
son; doubtless, when they see him they will respect him.
<sup class="v">20:14</sup>But seeing him, the husbandmen reasoned
with themselves, saying, This is the heir; let us kill him, that
the inheritance may be ours. <sup class="v">20:15</sup>And they
cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What, therefore, will
the lord of the vineyard do to them? <sup class="v">20:16</sup>He
will come and destroy those husbandmen, and let the vineyard to
others. And hearing this, they said, By no means. <sup class=
"v">20:17</sup>And he looked at them and said, What, then, is this
which is written? The stone which the builders rejected has become
the head of a corner; <sup class="v">20:18</sup>every one that
falls on that stone shall be bruised; but on whomsoever it shall
fall it shall crush him to atoms. <sup class="v">20:19</sup>And the
scribes and chief priests sought to lay hands on him at that time;
and they feared the people; for they knew that he spoke this
parable to them.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">20:20</sup>And they sent spies to
watch him, who pretended to be righteous men, that they might take
advantage of his speech, to deliver him to the power and authority
of the procurator. <sup class="v">20:21</sup>And they asked him
saying, Teacher, we know that you speak and teach correctly, and
respect no person, but teach the way of God in truth. <sup class=
"v">20:22</sup>Is it lawful for us to pay tribute to C&aelig;sar,
or not? <sup class="v">20:23</sup>And perceiving their craftiness,
he said to them, <sup class="v">20:24</sup>Show me a denarius [14
cents]. Whose figure and inscription has it? And they answered and
said, C&aelig;sar's. <sup class="v">20:25</sup>And he said to them,
Render therefore C&aelig;sar's dues to C&aelig;sar, and God's to
God. <sup class="v">20:26</sup>And they were not able to take
advantage of his word before the people; and they wondered at his
answer, and were silent.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">20:27</sup>And some of the
Sadducees came forward, who deny that there is a resurrection, and
asked him, <sup class="v">20:28</sup>saying, Teacher, Moses wrote
to us, that if one's brother dies, having a wife, and dies
childless, his brother shall take his wife and raise up children
for his brother. <sup class="v">20:29</sup>There were, therefore,
seven brothers; and the first took a wife, and died childless;
<sup class="v">20:30</sup>and the second and third took her;
<sup class="v">20:31</sup>and in like manner also the seven; [and
they] left no children, and died. <sup class="v">20:32</sup>And
last, the woman died also. <sup class="v">20:33</sup>In the
resurrection, therefore, which of them has her for a wife? for the
seven had her for a wife. <sup class="v">20:34</sup>And Jesus said
to them, The children of this life marry and are married;
<sup class="v">20:35</sup>but those who are judged worthy to attain
that life, and the resurrection of the dead, neither marry nor are
married; <sup class="v">20:36</sup>neither can they die any more;
for they are equal to the angels, and are sons of God, being sons
of the resurrection. <sup class="v">20:37</sup>But that the dead
are raised, even Moses showed at the bush, when he called the Lord,
The God of Abraham, and God of Isaac, and God of Jacob. <sup class=
"v">20:38</sup>But God is not [a God] of the dead, but of the
living; for all live to him. <sup class="v">20:39</sup>And some of
the scribes answered and said, Teacher, you have spoken well.
<sup class="v">20:40</sup>And they dared not question him any
more.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">20:41</sup>And he said to them,
How do they say that the Christ is the son of David? <sup class=
"v">20:42</sup>And David himself says in the book of Psalms, The
Lord said to my Lord, Sit on my right hand, <sup class=
"v">20:43</sup>till I make your enemies your footstool. <sup class=
"v">20:44</sup>David, therefore, calls him Lord; and how is he his
son?</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">20:45</sup>And in the hearing of
all the people he said to them, <sup class="v">20:46</sup>Beware of
the scribes, who delight to walk in long robes, and love
salutations in the markets, and the first seats in the synagogues,
and the first places at feasts; <sup class="v">20:47</sup>who
devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayers; they
shall receive a greater judgment.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">21:1</sup>And looking up he saw
the rich casting their gifts into the treasury. <sup class=
"v">21:2</sup>And he saw also a certain poor widow cast in there
two lepta [4 mills]. <sup class="v">21:3</sup>And he said, I tell
you truly, that this poor widow has cast in more than all;
<sup class="v">21:4</sup>for all these have cast among the gifts
from their abundance; but she from her want has cast in all the
living she had.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST PREDICTING THE DESTRUCTION OF JERUSALEM AND HIS OWN
EXALTATION.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">21:5</sup>AND some speaking of
the temple, that it was adorned with beautiful stones and votive
offerings, he said, <sup class="v">21:6</sup>As to these things
which you see, the days will come in which stone shall not be left
upon stone that shall not be thrown down. <sup class=
"v">21:7</sup>And they asked him, saying, Teacher, when then shall
these things be? and what sign [shall there be], when these things
are about to occur? <sup class="v">21:8</sup>And he said, See that
you be not deceived; for many shall come in my name, saying, I am
[Christ], and the time is at hand; go not after them. <sup class=
"v">21:9</sup>And when you hear of wars and insurrections, be not
terrified, for these things must be first; but the end is not
immediately.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">21:10</sup>Then said he to them,
Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom;
<sup class="v">21:11</sup>and in places there shall be great
earthquakes, and famines, and pestilences; and there shall also be
fearful sights and great signs from heaven. <sup class=
"v">21:12</sup>But before all these things they shall lay their
hands on you, and persecute you, committing you to synagogues and
prisons, to be brought before kings and governors on my account;
<sup class="v">21:13</sup>and it shall result to you for a
testimony. <sup class="v">21:14</sup>Settle it in your minds,
therefore, not to premeditate what defense you shall make,
<sup class="v">21:15</sup>for I will give you a mouth and wisdom
which all your enemies shall not be able to resist or dispute.
<sup class="v">21:16</sup>And you shall be delivered up by parents,
and brothers, and relatives, and friends; and they shall kill some
of you; <sup class="v">21:17</sup>and you shall be hated by all on
my account; <sup class="v">21:18</sup>and a hair of your heads
shall by no means perish; <sup class="v">21:19</sup>by your
patience you shall save your souls.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">21:20</sup>But when you see
Jerusalem surrounded with encampments, then know that its
desolation is at hand. <sup class="v">21:21</sup>Then let those in
Judea flee to the mountains; and those in the midst of it depart
out of it; and let those in country places not enter into it.
<sup class="v">21:22</sup>For these are days of judgment, that all
things which are written may be fully accomplished. <sup class=
"v">21:23</sup>But woe to those with child, and having children at
the breast in those days; for there shall be great distress on the
earth, and wrath against this people. <sup class="v">21:24</sup>And
they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and be carried away
captive to all nations, and Jerusalem shall be trodden down by
gentiles, till the times of gentiles are fully accomplished.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">21:25</sup>And there shall be
signs in the sun, and moon, and stars; and on the earth distress of
nations, with perplexity [at] the roaring of the sea and waves,
<sup class="v">21:26</sup>men dying with fear and an expectation of
evils to come on the world; for the hosts of the heavens shall be
shaken. <sup class="v">21:27</sup>And then shall they see the Son
of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. <sup class=
"v">21:28</sup>When these things begin to occur, arise and lift up
your heads, for your redemption is near.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">21:29</sup>And he spoke to them a
parable; See the fig tree and all the trees; <sup class=
"v">21:30</sup>when they now put forth, observing you know of
yourselves that summer already is nigh; <sup class=
"v">21:31</sup>so, also, when you see all these things occur, know
that the kingdom of God is nigh. <sup class="v">21:32</sup>I tell
you truly, that this generation shall by no means pass away till
all these things are accomplished. <sup class="v">21:33</sup>Heaven
and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.
<sup class="v">21:34</sup>Take heed to yourselves, that your hearts
be not oppressed with revelling and drunkenness, and worldly cares,
and that day come upon you suddenly; <sup class="v">21:35</sup>for
it shall come like a snare on all who live on the face of the whole
earth. <sup class="v">21:36</sup>But watch continually, praying
that you may be accounted worthy to escape all these things which
are about to occur, and to stand before the Son of man.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">21:37</sup>And he taught during
the days in the temple, and went out and spent the nights on the
mountain called the Mount of Olives. <sup class="v">21:38</sup>And
all the people came early to him in the temple to hear him.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>
<h3>JUDAS AGREES TO BETRAY HIS MASTER, THE LAST SUPPER, AMBITION
DISCOURAGED, THE DISCIPLES WARNED.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">22:1</sup>AND the feast of
unleavened bread approached, called the passover. <sup class=
"v">22:2</sup>And the chief priests and scribes sought how they
might destroy him, for they feared the people. <sup class=
"v">22:3</sup>And Satan entered into Judas, called Iscariot, who
was of the number of the twelve; <sup class="v">22:4</sup>and he
went and conferred with the chief priests and commanders as to how
he might deliver him to them. <sup class="v">22:5</sup>And they
were glad, and agreed to give him money. <sup class=
"v">22:6</sup>And he promised, and sought a convenient opportunity
to betray him to them in the absence of the people.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">22:7</sup>And the day of
unleavened bread came, in which it was necessary to kill the
paschal lamb. <sup class="v">22:8</sup>And he sent Peter and John,
saying, Go, prepare for us the passover, that we may eat.
<sup class="v">22:9</sup>And they said to him, Where do you wish us
to prepare? <sup class="v">22:10</sup>And he said to them, Behold,
as you enter into the city, a man will meet you, bearing an earthen
vessel of water; follow him into the house where he enters,
<sup class="v">22:11</sup>and say to the master of the house, The
teacher says to you, where is the public room in which I may eat
the passover with my disciples? <sup class="v">22:12</sup>And he
will show you a large upper room furnished; there prepare.
<sup class="v">22:13</sup>And they went and found as he had said to
them and prepared the passover.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">22:14</sup>And when the hour had
come, he sat down, and the apostles with him; <sup class=
"v">22:15</sup>and he said to them, I have greatly desired to eat
this passover with you before I suffer; <sup class=
"v">22:16</sup>for I tell you that I will eat it no more till it is
fulfilled in the kingdom of God. <sup class="v">22:17</sup>And
taking a cup, he gave thanks, and said, Take this and divide it
among you; <sup class="v">22:18</sup>for I tell you that I will not
drink of the product of the vine, till the kingdom of God has come.
<sup class="v">22:19</sup>And taking bread, and giving thanks, he
broke and gave them, saying, This is my body given for you; this do
in remembrance of me. <sup class="v">22:20</sup>And the cup in like
manner, after supper, saying, This cup is the new covenant [sealed]
with my blood, which is poured out for you. <sup class=
"v">22:21</sup>But behold, the hand of the traitor is with me on
the table; <sup class="v">22:22</sup>for the Son of man goes as it
has been determined, but woe to that man by whom he is betrayed.
<sup class="v">22:23</sup>And they inquired among themselves which
of them it was who was about to do this.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">22:24</sup>And there was a
contention among them as to which of them should be the greatest.
<sup class="v">22:25</sup>And he said to them, The kings of the
nations exercise lordship over them; and those having power are
called their benefactors. <sup class="v">22:26</sup>But you shall
not be so. But let the greater among you be as the younger, and the
chief as he that serves. <sup class="v">22:27</sup>For which is
greater, he that reclines, or he that serves? Is not he that
reclines? But I am with you as he that serves. <sup class=
"v">22:28</sup>And you have continued with me in my trials,
<sup class="v">22:29</sup>and I appoint you, as my Father has
appointed me, a kingdom, <sup class="v">22:30</sup>that you may eat
and drink at my table, in my kingdom, and sit on thrones, judging
the twelve tribes of Israel.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">22:31</sup>Simon, Simon, behold,
Satan has desired you, to sift like wheat; <sup class=
"v">22:32</sup>but I have prayed for you, that your faith may not
entirely fail; and when you recover yourself, confirm your
brothers. <sup class="v">22:33</sup>And he said to him, Lord, I am
ready to go with you to prison and to death. <sup class=
"v">22:34</sup>And he said, I tell you, Peter, a cock shall not
crow today, before you shall deny thrice that you know me.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">22:35</sup>And he said to them,
When I sent you out without a purse, and provision sack, and
sandals, did you want any thing? And they said, Nothing.
<sup class="v">22:36</sup>Then he said to them, But now let him
that has a purse take it, and a provision sack likewise; and he
that has not a sword, let him sell his cloak and buy one.
<sup class="v">22:37</sup>For I tell you, that this which is
written must be fully accomplished in me, And he was numbered with
transgressors; for also the things concerning me have an end.
<sup class="v">22:38</sup>And they said, Lord, behold, here are two
swords. And he said to them, It is sufficient.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST IN GETHSEMANE AND BEFORE THE SANHEDRIM.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">22:39</sup>AND going out, he
went, according to his custom to the Mount of Olives; and the
disciples followed him. <sup class="v">22:40</sup>And arriving at
the place, he said to them, Pray that you may not enter into trial.
<sup class="v">22:41</sup>And he withdrew from them about a stone's
throw, and kneeling down, prayed, <sup class="v">22:42</sup>saying,
Father, if thou wilt, take this cup away from me; but not my will,
but thine be done. <sup class="v">22:43</sup>And an angel appeared
to him from heaven, strengthening him. <sup class=
"v">22:44</sup>And being in agony, he prayed more earnestly; and
his sweat was like large drops of blood falling down to the ground.
<sup class="v">22:45</sup>And rising from prayer, and coming to the
disciples, he found them sleeping from grief, <sup class=
"v">22:46</sup>and he said to them, Why do you sleep? Arise, and
pray that you may not enter into trial.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">22:47</sup>And while he was yet
speaking, behold a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of
the twelve, came before them, and he approached Jesus to kiss him.
<sup class="v">22:48</sup>But Jesus said to him, Judas, do you
betray the Son of man with a kiss? <sup class="v">22:49</sup>And
those about him seeing what was about to occur, said, Lord, shall
we strike with the sword? <sup class="v">22:50</sup>And one of them
struck the servant of the chief priest, and took off his right ear.
<sup class="v">22:51</sup>But Jesus answered and said, Suffer even
this; and touching his ear he healed him. <sup class=
"v">22:52</sup>And Jesus said to the chief priests, and commanders
of the temple, and elders who came against him, Have you come with
swords and clubs, as against a robber? <sup class=
"v">22:53</sup>When I was daily with you in the temple you
stretched not out your hands upon me but this is your hour, and the
power of darkness.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">22:54</sup>And apprehending him,
they led him away, and conducted him to the house of the chief
priest; and Peter followed at a distance. <sup class=
"v">22:55</sup>And they having kindled a fire in the midst of the
court, and sat down, Peter sat in the midst of them. <sup class=
"v">22:56</sup>And a certain female servant seeing him sitting by
the light, and looking steadily at him, said, This man also was
with him. <sup class="v">22:57</sup>But he denied him, saying, I do
not know him, woman. <sup class="v">22:58</sup>And after a little,
another seeing him, said, You also are one of them. But Peter said,
Man, I am not. <sup class="v">22:59</sup>And about an hour
intervening, another strongly affirmed, saying, Certainly, this man
was also with him; for he is also a Galilean. <sup class=
"v">22:60</sup>But Peter said, Man, I know not what you say. And
immediately, while he was yet speaking, a cock crew. <sup class=
"v">22:61</sup>And the Lord turned and looked at Peter; and Peter
was reminded of the Lord's word, that he said to him, Before a cock
crows to-day you shall deny me thrice; <sup class=
"v">22:62</sup>and going out, Peter wept bitterly.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">22:63</sup>And the men having him
in custody mocked him, beating him; <sup class="v">22:64</sup>and
blindfolding him they asked him, saying, Prophecy who it is that
struck you? <sup class="v">22:65</sup>And they reviled him with
many other words.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">22:66</sup>And when it was day,
the eldership of the people, and the chief priests, and scribes
were assembled, and they brought him into their sanhedrim, saying,
<sup class="v">22:67</sup>If you are the Christ, tell us? And he
said to them, If I tell you you will not believe; <sup class=
"v">22:68</sup>and if I ask you will not answer. <sup class=
"v">22:69</sup>But from this time the Son of man will sit on the
right hand of the power of God. <sup class="v">22:70</sup>And they
all said, Are you the Son of God then? And he said to them, I am as
you say. <sup class="v">22:71</sup>And they said, What further need
have we of testimony? for we ourselves have heard from his
mouth.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXX.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST BEFORE PILATE AND HEROD, HIS CONDEMNATION.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">23:1</sup>AND all the multitude
arose and led him to Pilate. <sup class="v">23:2</sup>And they
accused him, saying, We have found this man perverting our nation,
and forbidding to pay tribute to C&aelig;sar, saying that he is an
anointed king. <sup class="v">23:3</sup>And Pilate asked him,
saying, Are you the king of the Jews? And he answered and said to
him, As you say. <sup class="v">23:4</sup>And Pilate said to the
chief priests, and the multitudes, I find no fault with this man.
<sup class="v">23:5</sup>And they were more violent, saying, He
excites the people, teaching in all Judea, beginning from Galilee
even to this place. <sup class="v">23:6</sup>And Pilate hearing of
Galilee asked if the man was a Galilean. <sup class=
"v">23:7</sup>And learning that he was of the province of Herod, he
sent him to Herod, who was himself also at Jerusalem in those
days.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">23:8</sup>And when Herod saw
Jesus he was much pleased; for he had wished for a long time to see
him, because he had beard about him, and he hoped to see some
miracle performed by him. <sup class="v">23:9</sup>And he
questioned him with many words; but he answered him nothing.
<sup class="v">23:10</sup>And the chief priests and scribes stood
up, violently accusing him. <sup class="v">23:11</sup>And Herod,
with his soldiers, treated him with contempt, and mocked him, and
put on him a splendid garment, and sent him back to Pilate.
<sup class="v">23:12</sup>And Pilate and Herod became friends to
each other on that day; for they had before been enemies to each
other.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">23:13</sup>And Pilate having
called the chief priests, and rulers, and the people, <sup class=
"v">23:14</sup>said to them, You have brought me this man as one
that perverts the people; and behold, having had an examination
before you, I have found in this man no cause for the charges which
you bring against him, <sup class="v">23:15</sup>but neither has
Herod, for I sent you to him, and behold, nothing worthy of death
has been done by him; <sup class="v">23:16</sup>having chastised
him therefore, I will release him. <sup class="v">23:18</sup>And
the whole multitude cried out, saying, Take away this man, and
release to us Barabbas; <sup class="v">23:19</sup>who had been cast
into prison for a certain sedition made in the city, and a
murder.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">23:20</sup>Pilate therefore
addressed them again, wishing to release Jesus; <sup class=
"v">23:21</sup>but they replied, saying, Crucify him, crucify him.
<sup class="v">23:22</sup>And he said to them a third time, [Why],
for what evil has this man done? I have found no cause of death in
him; having chastised him therefore, I will release him.
<sup class="v">23:23</sup>And they beset him with loud cries,
demanding that he should be crucified; and their cries, and those
of the chief priests, prevailed; <sup class="v">23:24</sup>and
Pilate answered, that their demand should be granted. <sup class=
"v">23:25</sup>And he released him that was cast into prison for
sedition and murder, whom they desired, and delivered up Jesus to
their will.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXI.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST'S CRUCIFIXION, DEATH, AND BURIAL.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">23:26</sup>AND when they led him
away, they took Simon, a certain Cyrenian, coming from the country,
and put on him the cross to bear after Jesus. <sup class=
"v">23:27</sup>And there followed him a great multitude of the
people, and of women; and they bewailed and lamented him.
<sup class="v">23:28</sup>And turning to them, Jesus said,
Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves,
and for your children. <sup class="v">23:29</sup>For behold, days
come in which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and those who
have not borne children, and the breasts which have not nursed
them! <sup class="v">23:30</sup>Then shall they say to the
mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us; <sup class=
"v">23:31</sup>for if they do these things with the green tree,
what shall be done with the dry? <sup class="v">23:32</sup>And two
other criminals were led out to be put to death with him.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">23:33</sup>And when they arrived
at the place called Cranium, there they crucified him, and the
criminals; one on his right hand, and the other on his left.
<sup class="v">23:34</sup>And Jesus said, Father, forgive them, for
they know not what they do. And distributing his garments they cast
lots [for them]. <sup class="v">23:35</sup>And the people stood
beholding. And the rulers also scoffed, saying, He saved others; if
this is the Christ, the elect of God, let him save himself.
<sup class="v">23:36</sup>And the soldiers also mocked him, and
came and presented him vinegar, <sup class="v">23:37</sup>and said,
If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself. <sup class=
"v">23:38</sup>And there was an inscription over him; THIS IS THE
KING OF THE JEWS.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">23:39</sup>And one of the
criminals crucified, reviled him, [saying], Are you not the Christ?
save yourself and us. <sup class="v">23:40</sup>But the other
answered and rebuked him, and said, Do you not fear God, since you
are under the same sentence? <sup class="v">23:41</sup>and we
indeed justly, for we receive the desert of our doings; but this
man has done nothing amiss. <sup class="v">23:42</sup>And he said,
Jesus, remember me when you come in your kingdom. <sup class=
"v">23:43</sup>And he said to him, I tell you truly, to-day you
shall be with me in paradise.</p>
<p class="pin"></p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">23:44</sup>And it was now about
the sixth hour [noon]; and there was a darkness over all the land
till the ninth hour [3 P.M.]. <sup class="v">23:45</sup>And the sun
was obscured; and the vail in the midst of the temple was rent in
two. <sup class="v">23:46</sup>And Jesus crying with a loud voice,
said, Father, into thy hands I commit my spirit; and having said
this, he expired. <sup class="v">23:47</sup>And the centurion
seeing what was done, glorified God, saying, Truly this was a
righteous man. <sup class="v">23:48</sup>And all the multitudes who
had come together to this spectacle, beholding what was done,
returned beating their breasts. <sup class="v">23:49</sup>And all
his friends stood at a distance, and the women who had followed him
from Galilee, seeing these things.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">23:50</sup>And behold, a man by
the name of Joseph, a counsellor, a good and righteous man,
<sup class="v">23:51</sup>this man had not consented to their
design and doing, [he was] from Arimathea, a city of the Jews, and
he expected the kingdom of God. <sup class="v">23:52</sup>This man
coming to Pilate asked for the body of Jesus; <sup class=
"v">23:53</sup>and taking it down, he wrapped it in linen, and laid
it in a tomb cut out of a rock, in which no man had yet been laid.
<sup class="v">23:54</sup>And the day was the preparation; the
sabbath was dawning.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXII.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST AFTER HIS RESURRECTION.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">23:55</sup>AND women following
him who had come up with him from Galilee saw the tomb, and how his
body was laid. <sup class="v">23:56</sup>And they returned and
prepared spices and ointments, and rested on the sabbath, according
to the commandment.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">24:1</sup>And on the first day of
the week, early in the morning, they came to the tomb bringing the
spices which they had prepared. <sup class="v">24:2</sup>And they
found the stone rolled away from the tomb; <sup class=
"v">24:3</sup>and entering, found not the body. <sup class=
"v">24:4</sup>And while they were in doubt about this, behold, two
men stood by them in shining clothing. <sup class="v">24:5</sup>And
[the women] being afraid, and bowing their faces to the earth, they
said to them, Why do you seek the living with the dead? <sup class=
"v">24:6</sup>He is not here, but is raised. Remember how he told
you while he was yet in Galilee, <sup class="v">24:7</sup>saying,
The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of wicked men to be
crucified, and on the third day rise again. <sup class=
"v">24:8</sup>And they remembered his words; <sup class=
"v">24:9</sup>and returning from the tomb related all these things
to the eleven, and to all the rest. <sup class="v">24:10</sup>And
they were the Magdalene Mary, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of
James, and the others with them, who told these things to the
apostles. <sup class="v">24:11</sup>And their words appeared to
them like idle talk; and they believed them not.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">24:13</sup>And behold, two of
them went the same day to a village about sixty stadiums [7 miles]
from Jerusalem, called Emmaus; <sup class="v">24:14</sup>and they
conversed together of all these things which had happened.
<sup class="v">24:15</sup>And as they conversed and reasoned
together, Jesus also himself approaching walked with them;
<sup class="v">24:16</sup>but their eyes were restrained that they
did not know him. <sup class="v">24:17</sup>And he said to them,
What reports are these which you relate one to the other as you
walk and are sad? <sup class="v">24:18</sup>And one of them
answered, whose name was Cleopas, and said to him, Do you live
alone at Jerusalem and not know the things which have occurred in
it in these days? <sup class="v">24:19</sup>And he said to them,
What things? And they said to him, The things relating to Jesus the
Nazoraean, who was a prophet, mighty in work and word before God
and all the people; <sup class="v">24:20</sup>and how our chief
priests and rulers delivered him up to the sentence of death, and
crucified him, <sup class="v">24:21</sup>But we hoped that he was
the one who was to redeem Israel. But indeed, also, in addition to
all these things, today is the third day since these things
occurred; <sup class="v">24:22</sup>but some of our women also
astonished us, who being early at the tomb <sup class=
"v">24:23</sup>and not finding his body, came, saying that they had
seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive. <sup class=
"v">24:24</sup>And some of those with us went to the tomb, and
found even as the women had said; and him they saw not.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">24:25</sup>And he said to them, O
foolish men, and of a mind slow to believe all that the prophets
have spoken. <sup class="v">24:26</sup>Ought not the Christ to
suffer these things, and to enter into his glory? <sup class=
"v">24:27</sup>And from Moses, and from all the prophets, he
interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning
himself. <sup class="v">24:28</sup>And they approached the village
to which they were going; and he pretended to be going farther.
<sup class="v">24:29</sup>And they urged him, saying, Remain with
us, for it is near evening, and the day is already past. And he
went in to remain with them; <sup class="v">24:30</sup>and when he
reclined with them, taking bread, he blessed, and breaking, gave
them. <sup class="v">24:31</sup>And their eyes were opened, and
they knew him; and he vanished from their sight. <sup class=
"v">24:32</sup>And they said one to the other, Did not our hearts
burn within us when he spoke to us on the way? when he opened to us
the Scriptures? <sup class="v">24:33</sup>And rising up the same
hour they returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven, and those
with them, assembled together, <sup class="v">24:34</sup>saying,
The Lord has risen indeed and has appeared to Simon. <sup class=
"v">24:35</sup>And they related the things on the way, and how he
was known to them by the breaking of bread.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">24:36</sup>And as they were
saying these things he stood in the midst of them; <sup class=
"v">24:37</sup>and they being terrified and afraid, thought they
saw a spirit. <sup class="v">24:38</sup>And he said to them, Why
are you troubled? and why do doubts arise in your minds?
<sup class="v">24:39</sup>See my hands and my feet, that I am he;
feel of me, and see; for a spirit has not flesh and bones as you
see me have. <sup class="v">24:41</sup>And while they yet
disbelieved from joy, and wondered, he said to them, Have you any
food here? <sup class="v">24:42</sup>And they gave him part of a
broiled fish, and of a honeycomb; <sup class="v">24:43</sup>and
taking it, he eat before them.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">24:44</sup>And he said to them,
These are my words which I spoke to you while I was yet with you,
that all things written in the law of Moses, and Prophets, and
Psalms, concerning me, must be fully accomplished. <sup class=
"v">24:45</sup>Then he opened their understanding to understand the
Scriptures, <sup class="v">24:46</sup>and said to them, Thus it is
written, that the Christ should suffer, and rise from the dead on
the third day, <sup class="v">24:47</sup>and that a change of mind
and forgiveness of sins should be preached in his name to all
nations, beginning from Jerusalem. <sup class="v">24:48</sup>You
are witnesses of these things. <sup class="v">24:49</sup>Behold, I
send the promise of my Father upon you; but remain in the city till
you are endued with power from on high.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">24:50</sup>And he led them out as
far as Bethany, and lifting up his hands, blessed them; <sup class=
"v">24:51</sup>and while he was blessing them he departed from
them. <sup class="v">24:52</sup>And they returned to Jerusalem with
great joy, <sup class="v">24:53</sup>and were continually in the
temple, praising and blessing God.</p>
<h1 style="margin-top:6em; margin-bottom:1em"><A name="b43">THE GOSPEL OF
 JOHN.</A></h1>
<hr width="10%">
<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>
<h3>THE WORD.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">1:1</sup>IN the beginning was the
Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. <sup class=
"v">1:2</sup>This [Word] was in the beginning with God. <sup class=
"v">1:3</sup>All things existed through him, and without him not
one thing existed, which existed. <sup class="v">1:4</sup>In him
was life, and the life was the light of men; <sup class=
"v">1:5</sup>and the light shone in darkness, and the darkness
comprehended it not.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">1:6</sup>There was a man, sent by
God, whose name was John. <sup class="v">1:7</sup>This man came for
a testimony, to testify of the light, that all might believe
through him. <sup class="v">1:8</sup>He was not the light, but to
testify of the light. <sup class="v">1:9</sup>The light was the
true [light] which lights every man that comes into the world.
<sup class="v">1:10</sup>He was in the world, and the world existed
through him, and the world knew him not. <sup class=
"v">1:11</sup>He came to his own, and his own received him not.
<sup class="v">1:12</sup>But as many as received him, to them gave
he power to become sons of God, to them that believe on his name,
<sup class="v">1:13</sup>who are born not of superior blood, nor of
a will of the flesh, nor of a will of man, but of God.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">1:14</sup>And the Word became
flesh and tabernacled with us and we beheld his glory, a glory as
of an only child with a father, full of grace and truth.
<sup class="v">1:15</sup>John testified of him, and cried, saying,
This is the one of whom I said, He that comes after me existed
before me, for he was before me. <sup class="v">1:16</sup>For we
all have received of his fullness, and grace for grace; <sup class=
"v">1:17</sup>for the law was given by Moses, the grace and truth
were by Jesus Christ. <sup class="v">1:18</sup>No one has ever seen
God; the only Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he declared
[him].</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST DECLARED TO BE THE MESSIAH, AND COMMENCING HIS
MINISTRY.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">1:19</sup>AND this is the
testimony of John, when the Jews from Jerusalem sent priests and
Levites to ask him, Who are you? <sup class="v">1:20</sup>And he
confessed and denied not, and confessed, I am not the Christ.
<sup class="v">1:21</sup>And they asked him, What then? are you
Elijah? And he said, I am not. Are you the prophet? And he
answered, No. <sup class="v">1:22</sup>Then they said to him, Who
are you? that we may give an answer to them that sent us; what say
you of yourself? <sup class="v">1:23</sup>He said, I am the voice
of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord,
as Isaiah the prophet said.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">1:24</sup>And those sent were of
the Pharisees. <sup class="v">1:25</sup>And they asked him, and
said to him, Why then do you baptize, if you are not the Christ,
nor Elijah, nor the prophet? <sup class="v">1:26</sup>John answered
them saying, I baptize with water; but among you stands one whom
you know not. <sup class="v">1:27</sup>He is the one coming after
me, the strings of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie.
<sup class="v">1:28</sup>These things occurred in Bethany beyond
the Jordan, where John was baptizing.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">1:29</sup>On the next day he saw
Jesus coming to him, and said, Behold the Lamb of God, who takes
away the sin of the world. <sup class="v">1:30</sup>This is he of
whom I said, After me comes a man who was before me, for he was
before me. <sup class="v">1:31</sup>And I knew him not; but that he
might be made manifest to Israel, for this reason have I come
baptizing with water. <sup class="v">1:32</sup>And John testified
saying, I saw the Spirit descend like a dove from heaven, and it
remained on him. <sup class="v">1:33</sup>And I knew him not, but
he that sent me to baptize with water, he said to me, On whom you
see the Spirit descend and remain on him, this is he that baptizes
with the Holy Spirit. <sup class="v">1:34</sup>And I have seen and
testified that this is the Son of God.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">1:35</sup>On the next day John
was again standing, and two of his disciples, <sup class=
"v">1:36</sup>and looking at Jesus as he walked, he said, Behold
the Lamb of God. <sup class="v">1:37</sup>And his two disciples
heard him say this, and followed Jesus. <sup class=
"v">1:38</sup>And Jesus turning around, and seeing them following,
said to them, What do you seek? And they said to him, Rabbi, which
interpreted signifies Teacher, where do you stay? <sup class=
"v">1:39</sup>He said to them, Come and see. Then they went and saw
where he staid, and staid with him that day; it was about the tenth
hour. <sup class="v">1:40</sup>Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter,
was one of the two who heard from John, and followed him;
<sup class="v">1:41</sup>he first found his brother Simon, and said
to him, We have found the Messiah; which is interpreted, Christ
[Anointed]. <sup class="v">1:42</sup>He brought him to Jesus. Jesus
looking at him said, You are Simon, the son of Jonas; you shall be
called Cephas; which is interpreted, Peter [Rock].</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">1:43</sup>On the next day he
wished to go to Galilee, and he found Philip. And Jesus said to
him, Follow me. <sup class="v">1:44</sup>Now Philip was from
Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter. <sup class=
"v">1:45</sup>Philip found Nathanael, and said to him, We have
found him of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, wrote, Jesus,
the son of Joseph, from Nazareth. <sup class="v">1:46</sup>And
Nathanael said to him, Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?
Philip said to him, Come and see. <sup class="v">1:47</sup>Jesus
saw Nathanael coming to him, and said of him, See an Israelite
indeed, in whom is no guile. <sup class="v">1:48</sup>Nathanael
said to him, Whence do you know me? Jesus answered and said to him,
Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree I saw
you. <sup class="v">1:49</sup>Nathanael answered him, Rabbi, you
are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel. <sup class=
"v">1:50</sup>Jesus answered and said to him, Because I said to you
I saw you under the fig tree, do you believe? You shall see greater
things than these. <sup class="v">1:51</sup>And he said to him, I
tell you most truly, you shall see heaven opened and the angels of
God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST CHANGING WATER INTO WINE, RESIDING AT CAPERNAUM, AND
PURIFYING THE TEMPLE.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">2:1</sup>AND on the third day
there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was
there; <sup class="v">2:2</sup>and Jesus also was invited, and his
disciples, to the wedding. <sup class="v">2:3</sup>And the wine
falling short the mother of Jesus said to him, They have no wine.
<sup class="v">2:4</sup>Jesus said to her, What have you to do with
me, woman? My hour has not yet come. <sup class="v">2:5</sup>His
mother said to the servants, Do whatever he tells you. <sup class=
"v">2:6</sup>And there were six stone water jars there, placed for
the purification of the Jews, containing two or three metretes
[16.75 or 25.125 gallons] each. <sup class="v">2:7</sup>Jesus said
to them, Fill the water jars with water; and they filled them to
the top. <sup class="v">2:8</sup>And he said to them, Now draw out
and bear to the master of the feast; and they bore it. <sup class=
"v">2:9</sup>And when the master of the feast tasted of the water
made wine, and knew not whence it was,&mdash;but the servants knew
who had drawn the water,&mdash;the master of the feast called the
bridegroom <sup class="v">2:10</sup>and said to him, Every man
first presents the good wine, and when they have drunk freely, the
poorer; but you have kept the good wine till now. <sup class=
"v">2:11</sup>This first miracle did Jesus perform at Cana in
Galilee, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed on
him. <sup class="v">2:12</sup>After this he went down to Capernaum,
he and his mother, and his brothers, and his disciples, and
remained there a few days.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">2:13</sup>And the passover of the
Jews was nigh; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. <sup class=
"v">2:14</sup>And he found in the temple those that sold cattle,
and sheep, and doves, and the brokers sitting; <sup class=
"v">2:15</sup>and making a whip of cords he drove them all out of
the temple, also the sheep and cattle, and poured out the money of
the brokers, and overturned the tables, <sup class=
"v">2:16</sup>and said to those that sold doves, Take these things
hence; make not my Father's house a house of merchandise.
<sup class="v">2:17</sup>And his disciples remembered that it was
written, The zeal of thy house consumes me.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">2:18</sup>Then the Jews answered
and said to him, What sign do you show us, that you do these
things? <sup class="v">2:19</sup>Jesus answered and said to them,
Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it. <sup class=
"v">2:20</sup>Then the Jews said to him, Forty-six years was this
temple being built, and will you raise it in three days?
<sup class="v">2:21</sup>But he spoke of the temple of his body.
<sup class="v">2:22</sup>When, therefore, he was raised from the
dead, his disciples remembered that he said this, and they believed
the Scripture and the word which Jesus spoke.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST'S DISCOURSE WITH NICODEMUS.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">2:23</sup>AND when he was at
Jerusalem at the feast of the passover many believed on him, seeing
his miracles which he performed; <sup class="v">2:24</sup>but Jesus
did not trust himself to them, because he knew all men, <sup class=
"v">2:25</sup>for he had no need that any should testify of man,
for he knew what was in man.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">3:1</sup>And there was a man of
the Pharisees whose name was Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.
<sup class="v">3:2</sup>This man came to him by night and said to
him, Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God, for no
one can perform these miracles which you perform unless God is with
him. <sup class="v">3:3</sup>Jesus answered and said to him, I tell
you most truly, unless one has been born again he cannot see the
kingdom of God. <sup class="v">3:4</sup>Nicodemus said to him, How
can a man be born when he is old? can he become an unborn infant of
his mother a second time, and be born? <sup class=
"v">3:5</sup>Jesus answered, I tell you most truly, unless a man is
born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom
of God. <sup class="v">3:6</sup>That which is born of the flesh is
flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is a spirit.
<sup class="v">3:7</sup>Wonder not that I said to you, You must be
born again. <sup class="v">3:8</sup>The Spirit breathes where it
wills, and you hear its voice, but you know not whence it comes,
nor whither it goes; so is every one that has been born of the
Spirit.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">3:9</sup>Nicodemus answered and
said to him, How can these things be? <sup class=
"v">3:10</sup>Jesus answered and said to him, Are you a teacher of
Israel and know not these things? <sup class="v">3:11</sup>I tell
you most truly, that we speak what we know, and what we have seen
we testify; and you receive not our testimony. <sup class=
"v">3:12</sup>If I have told you earthly things and you believe
not, how will you believe if I should tell you heavenly things?
<sup class="v">3:13</sup>And no one has ascended into heaven but he
that came down from heaven, the Son of man who is in heaven.
<sup class="v">3:14</sup>And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the
wilderness, so must the Son of man be lifted up; <sup class=
"v">3:15</sup>that every one believing in him may have eternal
life. <sup class="v">3:16</sup>For God so loved the world that he
gave his only Son, that every one believing in him may not perish
but have eternal life. <sup class="v">3:17</sup>For God sent not
his Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world
through him might be saved. <sup class="v">3:18</sup>He that
believes in him is not judged; but he that believes not has been
judged already; because he has not believed in the name of the only
Son of God. <sup class="v">3:19</sup>And this is the judgment; that
the light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather
than the light, because their deeds are evil. <sup class=
"v">3:20</sup>For every one that does evil hates the light, and
comes not to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved;
<sup class="v">3:21</sup>but he that does good comes to the light,
that his deeds may be made manifest, for they are wrought in
God.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST BAPTIZING, AND PREACHING TO THE SAMARITANS.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">3:22</sup>AFTER these things
Jesus and his disciples came into the country of Judea; and there
he staid with them, and baptized. <sup class="v">3:23</sup>And John
also was baptizing at &AElig;non, near Salim, because there were
many waters there; and they came and were baptized, <sup class=
"v">3:24</sup>for John was not yet cast into prison. <sup class=
"v">3:25</sup>Then there was a controversy of the disciples of John
with a Jew concerning purification. <sup class="v">3:26</sup>And
they came to John and said to him, Rabbi, he that was with you
beyond the Jordan, to whom you testified, behold, this [man]
baptizes and all men come to him. <sup class="v">3:27</sup>John
answered and said, A man can receive nothing unless it is given him
from heaven. <sup class="v">3:28</sup>You yourselves bear me
witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but am sent before him.
<sup class="v">3:29</sup>He that has the bride is the bridegroom;
but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him,
rejoices greatly at the bridegroom's voice; this my joy, therefore,
is fully attained. <sup class="v">3:30</sup>He must increase, but I
must decrease. <sup class="v">3:31</sup>He that comes from above is
above all; he that is of the earth is of the earth, and speaks of
the earth. He that comes from heaven is above all; <sup class=
"v">3:32</sup>and what he has seen and heard this he testifies; and
no one receives his testimony. <sup class="v">3:33</sup>He that
receives his testimony has sealed that God is true. <sup class=
"v">3:34</sup>For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God; for
God gives not the Spirit by measure. <sup class="v">3:35</sup>The
Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand.
<sup class="v">3:36</sup>He that believes on the Son has eternal
life; but he that disbelieves the Son shall not see life, but the
wrath of God continues on him.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">4:1</sup>When, therefore, the
Lord knew that the Pharisees heard that Jesus made and baptized
more disciples than John, <sup class="v">4:2</sup>though Jesus
himself indeed baptized not, but his disciples, <sup class=
"v">4:3</sup>he left Judea and departed again to Galilee.
<sup class="v">4:4</sup>And it was necessary that he should pass
through Samaria. <sup class="v">4:5</sup>He came, therefore, to a
city of Samaria called Sychar, near the lot which Jacob gave his
son Joseph. <sup class="v">4:6</sup>And Jacob's well was there.
Jesus, therefore, being fatigued with travelling sat thus by the
well; it was about the sixth hour [noon]. <sup class="v">4:7</sup>A
woman of Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, Give me a
drink; <sup class="v">4:8</sup>for his disciples had gone away into
the city to buy provisions. <sup class="v">4:9</sup>Then the
Samaritan woman said to him, How do you, being a Jew, ask a drink
of me, who am a Samaritan? for the Jews do no business with the
Samaritans. <sup class="v">4:10</sup>Jesus answered and said to
her, If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that says to you,
Give me a drink, you would have asked him, and he would have given
you living water. <sup class="v">4:11</sup>The woman said to him,
Sir, you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep; whence
then have you the living water? <sup class="v">4:12</sup>Are you
greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and who drank
of it himself, and his sons, and his cattle? <sup class=
"v">4:13</sup>Jesus answered and said to her, Every one that drinks
of this water will thirst again; <sup class="v">4:14</sup>but
whoever drinks of the water which I will give him shall never
thirst; but the water which I will give him shall be in him a
fountain of water springing up to eternal life. <sup class=
"v">4:15</sup>The woman said to him, Sir, give me this water, that
I thirst not, nor come here to draw. <sup class="v">4:16</sup>He
said to her, Go and call your husband, and come here. <sup class=
"v">4:17</sup>The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus
said to her, You have said well, I have no husband; <sup class=
"v">4:18</sup>for you have had five husbands, and he whom you now
have is not your husband. In this you have spoken truly.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">4:19</sup>The woman said to him,
Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet. <sup class=
"v">4:20</sup>Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, and you say
that Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship. <sup class=
"v">4:21</sup>Jesus said to her, Believe me, woman, the hour comes,
when neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, you shall worship
the Father. <sup class="v">4:22</sup>You worship what you know not;
we worship what we know; for salvation is of the Jews. <sup class=
"v">4:23</sup>But the hour comes, and now is, when the true
worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth; for the
Father seeks such to worship him. <sup class="v">4:24</sup>God is a
Spirit, and those that worship him must worship in spirit and
truth. <sup class="v">4:25</sup>The woman said to him, I know that
the Messiah is coming, called Christ; when he comes he will tell us
all things. <sup class="v">4:26</sup>Jesus said to her, I that
speak to you am [the Messiah].</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">4:27</sup>And upon this his
disciples came, and wondered that he talked with the woman; but no
one said to him, What do you seek? or why do you talk with her?
<sup class="v">4:28</sup>Then the woman left her bucket, and went
to the city, and said to the men, <sup class="v">4:29</sup>Come and
see a man who has told me all things which I have done; is this the
Christ? <sup class="v">4:30</sup>They came out from the city and
came to him.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">4:31</sup>In the meantime the
disciples asked him saying, Rabbi, eat. <sup class=
"v">4:32</sup>But he said to them, I have food to eat which you
know not of. <sup class="v">4:33</sup>Then the disciples said one
to another, Has any one brought him food to eat? <sup class=
"v">4:34</sup>Jesus said to them, My food is to do the will of him
that sent me, and to finish his work. <sup class="v">4:35</sup>Do
you not say, There are yet four months, and the harvest comes?
behold, I say to you, lift up your eyes and see the fields; for
they are white for a harvest. <sup class="v">4:36</sup>Already he
that reaps receives wages and gathers fruit for life eternal, that
he that sows and he that reaps may rejoice together. <sup class=
"v">4:37</sup>For in this is the saying true; He that sows is one,
and he that reaps is another. <sup class="v">4:38</sup>I have sent
you to reap that on which you have not labored; others have labored
and you have entered into their labor.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">4:39</sup>And many of the
Samaritans in that city believed on him, on account of the word of
the woman, testifying, He told me all things which I have done.
<sup class="v">4:40</sup>When, therefore, the Samaritans came to
him, they desired him to remain with them; and he remained there
two days. <sup class="v">4:41</sup>And many more believed on
account of his word, <sup class="v">4:42</sup>and said to the
woman, We no longer believe on account of your report, for we have
heard him ourselves, and know that this is truly the Saviour of the
world.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST IN GALILEE, CURING A NOBLEMAN'S SON.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">4:43</sup>AND after two days he
departed thence to Galilee. <sup class="v">4:44</sup>For Jesus
himself testified that a prophet is without honor in his native
country. <sup class="v">4:45</sup>When, therefore, he came into
Galilee, the Galileans received him, having seen all that he did at
Jerusalem at the feast; for they also came to the feast.
<sup class="v">4:46</sup>Then he came again to Cana in Galilee,
where he had made the water wine.</p>
<p class="pin">2 And there was a certain nobleman whose son was
sick at Capernaum. <sup class="v">4:47</sup>Hearing that Jesus had
come from Judea into Galilee, he went to him, and desired him to
come down and cure his son, for he was about to die. <sup class=
"v">4:48</sup>Then Jesus said to him, Unless you see miracles and
prodigies you will not believe. <sup class="v">4:49</sup>The
nobleman said to him, Lord, come down before my child dies.
<sup class="v">4:50</sup>Jesus said to him, Go; your son lives. The
man believed the word which Jesus said to him, and went.
<sup class="v">4:51</sup>And as he was now going down his servants
met him, and told, saying, Your child lives. <sup class=
"v">4:52</sup>Then he inquired of them the hour in which he became
better. Then they said to him, The fever left him yesterday, at the
seventh hour. <sup class="v">4:53</sup>Then the father knew that it
was in that hour in which Jesus said to him, Your son lives; and he
believed, and all his house. <sup class="v">4:54</sup>This second
miracle did Jesus, having come from Judea into Galilee.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST CURING A SICK MAN ON THE SABBATH, AT JERUSALEM.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">5:1</sup>AFTER these things there
was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
<sup class="v">5:2</sup>And there is at Jerusalem, by the
sheep-gate, a pool, called in Hebrew, Bethesda, having five
porches. <sup class="v">5:3</sup>In these lay a multitude of sick,
blind, lame, withered. <sup class="v">5:5</sup>And there was a
certain man there who had been sick thirty-eight years. <sup class=
"v">5:6</sup>Jesus seeing him lying, and knowing that he had now
been sick a long time, said to him, Do you wish to become well?
<sup class="v">5:7</sup>The sick man answered him, Sir, I have no
man, when the water is disturbed, to put me into the pool; but
while I am coming another goes down before me. <sup class=
"v">5:8</sup>Jesus said to him, Arise, take up your bed and walk.
<sup class="v">5:9</sup>And the man immediately became well, and
took up his bed and walked. That day was the sabbath.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">5:10</sup>The Jews, therefore,
said to him that was cured, It is the sabbath; it is not lawful for
you to carry the bed. <sup class="v">5:11</sup>He answered them, He
that made me well, he said to me, Take up your bed and walk.
<sup class="v">5:12</sup>They asked him, Who is the man that said
to you, Take up your bed and walk? <sup class="v">5:13</sup>And the
sick man knew not who it was; for Jesus had gone away, a multitude
being in that place. <sup class="v">5:14</sup>Afterwards Jesus
found him in the temple, and said to him, Behold, you have become
well; sin no more, lest a worse thing happen to you. <sup class=
"v">5:15</sup>The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus
who had made him well; <sup class="v">5:16</sup>and on this account
the Jews persecuted Jesus, because he had done these things on the
sabbath. <sup class="v">5:17</sup>But Jesus answered them, My
Father works even till now, and I work. <sup class=
"v">5:18</sup>Then, for this reason, the Jews sought the more to
kill him, because he not only broke the sabbath but also said, that
God was his Father, making himself equal with God. <sup class=
"v">5:19</sup>Then Jesus answered and said to them, I tell you most
truly, the Son can do nothing of himself, but what he sees the
Father do; for whatever he does, these things also does the Son in
like manner. <sup class="v">5:20</sup>For the Father loves the Son,
and shows him all things which he does; and greater works than
these will he show him, that you may wonder. <sup class=
"v">5:21</sup>For as the Father raises the dead, and makes them
alive, so also the Son makes alive whom he will. <sup class=
"v">5:22</sup>For the Father judges no man, but has given all
judgment to the Son, <sup class="v">5:23</sup>that all should honor
the Son as they honor the Father. He that honors not the Son honors
not the Father that sent him.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">5:24</sup>I tell you most truly,
he that hears my word and believes him that sent me has eternal
life, and comes not into judgment, but has passed from death to
life. <sup class="v">5:25</sup>I tell you most truly, that the hour
comes, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of
God, and those that hear shall live. <sup class="v">5:26</sup>For
as the Father has life in himself, so has he also given to the Son
to have life in himself; <sup class="v">5:27</sup>and has given him
authority and judgment to execute, because he is the Son of man.
<sup class="v">5:28</sup>Wonder not at this; for the hour comes in
which all that are in the tombs shall hear his voice <sup class=
"v">5:29</sup>and shall come forth; those that have done good to a
resurrection of life, and those that have done evil to a
resurrection of judgment. <sup class="v">5:30</sup>I can do nothing
of myself; as I hear, I judge, and my judgment is just, for I seek
not my will, but the will of him that sent me.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">5:31</sup>If I testify of myself
my testimony is not true. <sup class="v">5:32</sup>There is another
who testifies of me, and I know that the testimony which he
testifies of me is true. <sup class="v">5:33</sup>You sent to John,
and he testified to the truth; <sup class="v">5:34</sup>but I
receive not testimony from a man; but I say these things that you
may be saved. <sup class="v">5:35</sup>He was a burning and shining
light, and you were willing for a time to rejoice in his light.
<sup class="v">5:36</sup>But I have greater testimony than John's;
for the works which the Father has given me to finish, these works
which I do, testify of me that the Father has sent me; <sup class=
"v">5:37</sup>and the Father who sent me, he has testified of me.
You have not heard his voice at any time, nor seen his form;
<sup class="v">5:38</sup>and his word you have not continuing in
you, for whom he has sent, him you believe not. <sup class=
"v">5:39</sup>You search the Scriptures, because you think by them
to have eternal life; and they testify of me; <sup class=
"v">5:40</sup>and you will not come to me that you may have
life.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">5:41</sup>I receive not glory
from men, <sup class="v">5:42</sup>but I know you, that you have
not the love of God in you. <sup class="v">5:43</sup>I have come in
my Father's name and you receive me not; if another comes in his
own name, him will you receive. <sup class="v">5:44</sup>How can
you believe, receiving glory one from another, and the glory from
God alone you seek not? <sup class="v">5:45</sup>Think not that I
will accuse you to the Father; there is one that accuses you,
Moses, in whom you trust. <sup class="v">5:46</sup>For if you had
believed Moses, you would have believed me; for he wrote of me.
<sup class="v">5:47</sup>But if you believe not his writings, how
will you believe my words?</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST FEEDING FIVE THOUSAND, AND WALKING ON THE LAKE.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">6:1</sup>AFTER these things Jesus
went across the lake of Galilee, the Tiberias. <sup class=
"v">6:2</sup>And a great multitude followed him, because they saw
the miracles which he performed on the sick. <sup class=
"v">6:3</sup>And Jesus went up on the mountain and sat there with
his disciples. <sup class="v">6:4</sup>And the passover was nigh,
the feast of the Jews. <sup class="v">6:5</sup>Then Jesus lining up
his eyes, and seeing many people come to him, said to Philip,
Whence shall we buy bread that these may eat?</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">6:6</sup>But this he said to try
him; for he knew what he was about to do. <sup class=
"v">6:7</sup>Philip answered him, Two hundred denarii [$28] worth
of bread is not sufficient for them, that each may take a little.
<sup class="v">6:8</sup>One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's
brother, said to him, <sup class="v">6:9</sup>There is a boy here
who has five barley loaves and two fishes; but what are these for
so many? <sup class="v">6:10</sup>Jesus said, Make the men sit
down. And there was much grass in the place. The men, therefore,
sat down in number about five thousand. <sup class=
"v">6:11</sup>Then Jesus took the bread, and having given thanks,
distributed it to those reclining; likewise also of the fishes, as
much as they wished. <sup class="v">6:12</sup>And when they were
filled he said to his disciples, Collect the fragments that remain
over, that nothing may be lost. <sup class="v">6:13</sup>Then they
collected, and filled twelve traveling-baskets with the fragments
of the five barley loaves which remained over to those who had
eaten.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">6:14</sup>Then the men, seeing
what a miracle Jesus had performed, said, This is truly the prophet
who was to come into the world. <sup class="v">6:15</sup>And Jesus
knowing that they were about to come and take him by force to make
him a king, went up to the mountain himself alone.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">6:16</sup>And when it was
evening, his disciples went down to the lake, <sup class=
"v">6:17</sup>and entering into the ship were crossing the lake to
Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus had not come to them,
<sup class="v">6:18</sup>and the lake was made rough by a great
wind blowing. <sup class="v">6:19</sup>Then having gone about
twenty-five or thirty stadiums [3 or 3 1-2 miles], they saw Jesus
walking on the lake and coming near the ship, and they were afraid.
<sup class="v">6:20</sup>But he said to them, It is I; be not
afraid. <sup class="v">6:21</sup>Then they willingly took him into
the ship, and immediately the ship was at the land to which they
were going.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST AT CAPERNAUM PROCLAIMING HIMSELF THE SON OF GOD AND THE
BREAD OF LIFE.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">6:22</sup>ON the next day, the
multitude standing on the other side of the lake seeing that there
was no other boat there except one, and that Jesus entered not into
the ship with his disciples but his disciples had gone away
alone,&mdash; <sup class="v">6:23</sup>but other boats came from
Tiberias near the place where they had eaten bread after the Lord
gave thanks,&mdash; <sup class="v">6:24</sup>when, therefore, the
multitude saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they
went into the ships and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.
<sup class="v">6:25</sup>And finding him on the other side of the
lake they said to him, Rabbi, when came you hither? <sup class=
"v">6:26</sup>Jesus answered them and said, I tell you most truly,
you seek me not because you saw miracles, but because you eat of
the bread and were filled. <sup class="v">6:27</sup>Work not for
the food which perishes, but for the food which endures to eternal
life, which the Son of man will give you; for him has God the
Father sealed.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">6:28</sup>Then they said to him,
What shall we do to perform the works of God? <sup class=
"v">6:29</sup>Jesus answered and said to them, This is the work of
God; to believe on him whom he has sent. <sup class=
"v">6:30</sup>Then they said to him, What miracle do you perform,
that we may see and believe you? what work do you perform?
<sup class="v">6:31</sup>Our fathers eat the manna in the
wilderness, as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to
eat. <sup class="v">6:32</sup>Then Jesus said to them, I tell you
most truly, Moses gave you not bread from heaven, but my Father
gives you the true bread from heaven; <sup class="v">6:33</sup>for
the bread of God is he that comes down from heaven and gives life
to the world.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">6:34</sup>Then they said to him,
Sir, always give us this bread. <sup class="v">6:35</sup>Jesus said
to them, I am the bread of life; he that comes to me shall never
hunger, and he that believes in me shall never thirst. <sup class=
"v">6:36</sup>But I said to you, that you have seen me and believe
not. <sup class="v">6:37</sup>Every thing which the Father gives to
me shall come to me, and him that comes to me I will by no means
cast out; <sup class="v">6:38</sup>for I came down from heaven not
to do my will, but the will of him that sent me. <sup class=
"v">6:39</sup>And this is the will of him that sent me; that I
should lose nothing of all that he has given me, but should raise
it up at the last day. <sup class="v">6:40</sup>For this is the
will of my Father, that every one who sees the Son and believes in
him should have eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last
day.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">6:41</sup>Then the Jews
complained of him because he said, I am the bread which came down
from heaven. <sup class="v">6:42</sup>And they said, Is not this
Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how,
then, does he say, I came down from heaven? <sup class=
"v">6:43</sup>Then Jesus answered and said to them, Complain not
among yourselves. <sup class="v">6:44</sup>No one can come to me
unless the Father who sent me shall draw him; and I will raise him
up at the last day. <sup class="v">6:45</sup>It is written in the
prophets, And all shall be taught of God. Every one who has heard
and learned of the Father comes to me. <sup class="v">6:46</sup>Not
that any one has seen the Father except he that is from God; he has
seen the Father.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">6:47</sup>I tell you most truly,
He that believes has eternal life. <sup class="v">6:48</sup>I am
the bread of life. <sup class="v">6:49</sup>Your fathers eat manna
in the wilderness, and died; <sup class="v">6:50</sup>this is the
bread which comes down from heaven, that one may eat of it and not
die. <sup class="v">6:51</sup>I am the living bread which came down
from heaven; if any one eats of this bread, he shall live forever;
and the bread which I will give for the life of the world is my
flesh.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">6:52</sup>Then the Jews contended
one with another, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to
eat? <sup class="v">6:53</sup>Then Jesus said to them, I tell you
most truly, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink
his blood, you have no life in you. <sup class="v">6:54</sup>He
that eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will
raise him up at the last day. <sup class="v">6:55</sup>For my flesh
is the true food, and my blood is the true drink. <sup class=
"v">6:56</sup>He that eats my flesh and drinks my blood continues
in me, and I in him. <sup class="v">6:57</sup>As the living Father
sent me and I live by the Father, so he that eats me shall live by
me. <sup class="v">6:58</sup>This is the bread which came down from
heaven; not as your fathers eat and died, he that eats this bread
shall live forever. <sup class="v">6:59</sup>These things he said
in a synagogue, teaching in Capernaum.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">6:60</sup>Then many of his
disciples hearing him said, This is a hard saying; who can hear
him? <sup class="v">6:61</sup>And Jesus knowing in himself that his
disciples complained of this, said to them, Does this offend you?
<sup class="v">6:62</sup>[What], then if you should see the Son of
man ascend where he was formerly? <sup class="v">6:63</sup>The
Spirit is that which makes alive; the flesh profits nothing; the
words which I have spoken to you are spirit and life. <sup class=
"v">6:64</sup>But there are some of you who believe not. For Jesus
knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who he
was that would betray him. <sup class="v">6:65</sup>And on that
account he said, I told you that no one can come to me unless it
has been given him by my Father.</p>
<p class="pin">8 <sup class="v">6:66</sup>From this time many of
his disciples went away from following him, and walked no more with
him. <sup class="v">6:67</sup>Then Jesus said to the twelve Will
you also go away? <sup class="v">6:68</sup>Simon Peter answered
him, Lord, to whom shall we go? you have words of eternal life,
<sup class="v">6:69</sup>and we have believed and know that you are
the Holy [Son] of God. <sup class="v">6:70</sup>He answered them,
Have I not chosen you twelve? and of you one is a devil.
<sup class="v">6:71</sup>But he spoke of Judas the son of Simon
Iscariot, for he was about to betray him, being one of the twelve.
<sup class="v">7:1</sup>And after these things Jesus walked in
Galilee, for he would not walk in Judea because the Jews sought to
kill him.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST AT THE FEAST OF TABERNACLES.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">7:2</sup>AND the feast of the
Jews was nigh, the feast of tabernacles. <sup class=
"v">7:3</sup>Then his brothers said to him, Go down from here, and
go into Judea, that your disciples also may see your works which
you do; <sup class="v">7:4</sup>for no one does any thing in
secret, and seeks himself to be in public. If you do these things,
show yourself to the world. <sup class="v">7:5</sup>For his
brothers did not believe on him. <sup class="v">7:6</sup>Then Jesus
said to them, My time has not yet come, but your time is always
ready. <sup class="v">7:7</sup>The world cannot hate you, but me it
hates, because I testify of it that its works are evil. <sup class=
"v">7:8</sup>Do you go up to the feast; I go not up to this feast,
because my time has not yet fully come. <sup class=
"v">7:9</sup>Having said these things he continued in Galilee.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">7:10</sup>But when his brothers
had gone up, then he also went up to the feast, not openly, but as
it were in secret. <sup class="v">7:11</sup>Then the Jews sought
him at the feast, and said, Where is he? <sup class=
"v">7:12</sup>And there was much complaining concerning him among
the multitude; some said, He is a good man; others said, No; but he
deceives the people. <sup class="v">7:13</sup>Nevertheless, no one
spoke openly for him from fear of the Jews.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">7:14</sup>And in the midst of the
feast Jesus went up into the temple and taught. <sup class=
"v">7:15</sup>Then the Jews wondered, saying, How does this man
know letters, not having learned? <sup class="v">7:16</sup>Then
Jesus answered them and said, My teaching is not mine but his that
sent me. <sup class="v">7:17</sup>If any one will do his will, he
shall know of the teaching whether it is from God or whether I
speak from myself. <sup class="v">7:18</sup>He that speaks from
himself seeks his own glory; but he that seeks the glory of him
that sent him, this [man] is true, and no unrighteousness is in
him. <sup class="v">7:19</sup>Did not Moses give you the law? and
no one of you performs the law. Why do you seek to kill me?
<sup class="v">7:20</sup>The multitude answered, You have a demon;
who seeks to kill you? <sup class="v">7:21</sup>Jesus answered and
said to them, I performed one work and you all wonder. <sup class=
"v">7:22</sup>Moses gave you circumcision, not that it is of Moses
but of the fathers, and you circumcise a man on the sabbath.
<sup class="v">7:23</sup>If a man receives circumcision on the
sabbath, that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry
with me because I made a man entirely sound on the sabbath?
<sup class="v">7:24</sup>Judge not according to the appearance, but
judge a righteous judgment.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">7:25</sup>Then some of the
inhabitants of Jerusalem said, Is not this he whom they seek to
kill? <sup class="v">7:26</sup>And behold, he speaks boldly, and
they say nothing to him. Have the rulers at length learned that
this is the Christ? <sup class="v">7:27</sup>But we know this man
whence he is; but when the Christ comes, no one knows whence he is.
<sup class="v">7:28</sup>Then Jesus cried, teaching in the temple
and saying, You both know me and know whence I am; and I have not
come of myself; but he that sent me is true, whom you know not;
<sup class="v">7:29</sup>I know him, because I am from him, and he
sent me. <sup class="v">7:30</sup>Then they sought to take him by
force; but no man laid a hand on him, for his hour had not yet
come.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">7:31</sup>And many of the
multitude believed on him, and said, When the Christ comes will he
perform more miracles than this man has performed? <sup class=
"v">7:32</sup>The Pharisees heard the multitude saying these things
concerning him, and the chief priests and Pharisees sent to take
him by force. <sup class="v">7:33</sup>Then Jesus said, Yet a
little while am I with you, and I go to him that sent me.
<sup class="v">7:34</sup>You shall seek and shall not find, and
where I am you cannot come. <sup class="v">7:35</sup>Then the Jews
said one to another, Where is this man about to go, that we shall
not find him? Will he go to the dispersion of the Greeks, and teach
the Greeks? <sup class="v">7:36</sup>What does the word which he
said mean; You shall seek and shall not find me, and where I am you
cannot come?</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">7:37</sup>And on the last day,
the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any
one thirsts, let him come to me and drink. <sup class=
"v">7:38</sup>He that believes in me, as the Scripture has said,
out of him shall flow rivers of living water. <sup class=
"v">7:39</sup>But he said this of the Spirit which those believing
in him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet [given],
because Jesus was not yet glorified. <sup class="v">7:40</sup>Then
some of the multitude hearing these words, said, This is truly the
prophet; <sup class="v">7:41</sup>others said, This is the Christ;
others said, [No]; for does the Christ come from Galilee?
<sup class="v">7:42</sup>Has not the Scripture said that the Christ
comes from the offspring of David, and from Bethlehem, the village
where David was? <sup class="v">7:43</sup>Then there was a division
among the multitude on his account; <sup class="v">7:44</sup>and
some of them wished to take him by force, but no one laid hands on
him.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">7:45</sup>Then came the officers
to the chief priests and Pharisees, and they said to them, Why have
you not brought him? <sup class="v">7:46</sup>The officers
answered, A man never spoke thus. <sup class="v">7:47</sup>The
Pharisees answered them, Are you also deceived? <sup class=
"v">7:48</sup>Has any one of the rulers believed on him, or of the
Pharisees? <sup class="v">7:49</sup>But this multitude which know
not the law are accursed. <sup class="v">7:50</sup>Nicodemus, he
that came to him, being one of them, said to them, <sup class=
"v">7:51</sup>Does our law judge a man unless it first hears from
him and knows what he does? <sup class="v">7:52</sup>They answered
and said to him, Are you also from Galilee? search and see; for no
prophet is raised up from Galilee.</p>
<p class="pin">8 <sup class="v">7:53</sup>[An early
interpolation, but probably true]. And every man went to his own
house; <sup class="v">8:1</sup>and Jesus went to the Mount of
Olives. <sup class="v">8:2</sup>And in the morning he went again to
the temple, and all the people came to him, and he sat and taught
them. <sup class="v">8:3</sup>And the scribes and Pharisees brought
him a woman taken in adultery, and placing her in the midst
<sup class="v">8:4</sup>said to him, Teacher, this woman was taken
in adultery, in the very act. <sup class="v">8:5</sup>In the law,
Moses commanded us that such should be stoned; what therefore do
you say? <sup class="v">8:6</sup>They said this to try him, that
they might have something of which to accuse him. But Jesus,
stooping down, wrote with his finger on the ground. <sup class=
"v">8:7</sup>And when they continued asking him, rising up, he said
to them, Let him that has not sinned among you first cast the stone
at her. <sup class="v">8:8</sup>And again stooping down he wrote on
the ground. <sup class="v">8:9</sup>But they hearing, and being
convicted by their consciences, went out, one by one, beginning
with the oldest, even to the last; and Jesus was left alone, and
the woman standing in the midst. <sup class="v">8:10</sup>And Jesus
rising up and seeing no one but the woman, said to her, Woman,
where are those your accusers? Has no man condemned you?
<sup class="v">8:11</sup>And she said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said
to her, Neither do I condemn you; go, and sin no more.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST DECLARING HIMSELF THE SON OF GOD.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">8:12</sup>THEN Jesus spoke to
them again, saying, I am the light of the world; he that follows me
shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life.
<sup class="v">8:13</sup>Then the Pharisees said to him, You
testify of yourself; your testimony is not true. <sup class=
"v">8:14</sup>Jesus answered and said to them, Even if I testify of
myself, my testimony is true, for I know whence I came and whither
I go; but you know not whence I come or whither I go. <sup class=
"v">8:15</sup>You judge according to the flesh; I judge no one;
<sup class="v">8:16</sup>and even if I judge, my judgment is true,
because I am not alone, but I and the Father who sent me.
<sup class="v">8:17</sup>And it is written also in your law, that
the testimony of two men is true; <sup class="v">8:18</sup>I am
one, testifying of myself, and the Father who sent me testifies of
me. <sup class="v">8:19</sup>Then they said to him, Where is your
Father? Jesus answered, You have neither known me nor my Father; if
you had known me you would also have known my Father. <sup class=
"v">8:20</sup>These words he said in the treasury, teaching in the
temple; and no one took him by force, for his hour had not yet
come.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">8:21</sup>Then Jesus said to them
again, I go away, and you shall seek me and die in your sin; where
I go, you cannot come. <sup class="v">8:22</sup>Then the Jews said,
Will he kill himself, that he says, Where I go you cannot come?
<sup class="v">8:23</sup>And he said to them, You are from below; I
am from above; you are from this world; I am not from this world.
<sup class="v">8:24</sup>Therefore I said to you, You shall die in
your sins; for if you believe not that I am [the Christ], you shall
die in your sins. <sup class="v">8:25</sup>Then they said to him,
Who are you? And Jesus said to them, What at the beginning, and
what I tell you [now]. <sup class="v">8:26</sup>I have many things
to say and judge of you; but he that sent me is true; and what I
have heard from him, these things I speak in the world. <sup class=
"v">8:27</sup>They understood not that he spoke to them of the
Father. <sup class="v">8:28</sup>Then Jesus said to them, When you
shall lift up the Son of man, then shall you know that I am [the
Christ]; and I do nothing of myself; but I speak these things as
the Father has taught me; <sup class="v">8:29</sup>and he having
sent me is with me, he has not left me alone, for I always do the
things which please him.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">8:30</sup>When he said these
things many believed on him. <sup class="v">8:31</sup>Then Jesus
said to the Jews who believed on him, If you continue in my word,
you are my disciples indeed; <sup class="v">8:32</sup>and you shall
know the truth, and the truth shall make you free. <sup class=
"v">8:33</sup>They answered him, We are children of Abraham, and
were never in servitude to any one; how say you, You shall become
free? <sup class="v">8:34</sup>Jesus answered them, I tell you most
truly, that every one who commits sin is a servant of the sin.
<sup class="v">8:35</sup>But the servant continues not in the house
for ever; the Son continues for ever. <sup class="v">8:36</sup>If,
therefore, the Son shall make you free, you shall be free indeed.
<sup class="v">8:37</sup>I know that you are children of Abraham;
but you seek to kill me because my word has no place in you.
<sup class="v">8:38</sup>What I have seen with my Father I speak,
and you also do what you have heard from your father. <sup class=
"v">8:39</sup>They answered and said to him, Our father is Abraham.
Jesus said to them, If you were children of Abraham, you would have
done the works of Abraham; <sup class="v">8:40</sup>but now you
seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth, which I have
heard from God; Abraham did not do this. <sup class=
"v">8:41</sup>You do the works of your father. They said to him, We
were not born by fornication, we have one father, God. <sup class=
"v">8:42</sup>Jesus said to them, If God was your father you would
have loved me; for I came forth and come from God; for I came not
of myself, but he sent me. <sup class="v">8:43</sup>Why do you not
understand my speech? because you cannot hear my word. <sup class=
"v">8:44</sup>You are of your father the devil, and the desires of
your father you will to do. He was a murderer from the beginning
and stood not by the truth; for truth is not in him. When he speaks
a lie, he speaks from his own; for he is a liar, and the father of
him [that lies]. <sup class="v">8:45</sup>But because I tell you
the truth you believe me not. <sup class="v">8:46</sup>Who of you
convicts me of a sin? If I say the truth, why do you not believe
me? <sup class="v">8:47</sup>He that is of God hears the words of
God; you, therefore, hear not, because you are not of God.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">8:48</sup>The Jews answered and
said to him, Say we not well that you are a Samaritan, and have a
demon? <sup class="v">8:49</sup>Jesus answered, I have not a demon;
but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me. <sup class=
"v">8:50</sup>But I seek not my glory; there is one that seeks and
judges. <sup class="v">8:51</sup>I tell you most truly, if any one
shall keep my word he shall never see death. <sup class=
"v">8:52</sup>The Jews said to him, Now we know that you have a
demon. Abraham died, and the prophets; and you say, If any one
shall keep my word he shall never taste death. <sup class=
"v">8:53</sup>Are you greater than our father Abraham, who died?
and the prophets died; whom do you make yourself? <sup class=
"v">8:54</sup>Jesus answered, If I glorify myself, my glory is
nothing; it is my Father who glorifies me, of whom you say, He is
our God; <sup class="v">8:55</sup>and you have not known him, but I
have known him; and if I should say I do not know him, I should be
a liar like you; but I know him and keep his word. <sup class=
"v">8:56</sup>Abraham your father rejoiced to see my day, and he
saw, and was glad. <sup class="v">8:57</sup>Then the Jews said to
him, You have not yet fifty years, and have you seen Abraham?
<sup class="v">8:58</sup>Jesus said to them, I tell you most truly,
that before Abraham existed, I am. <sup class="v">8:59</sup>Then
they took up stones to cast at him; but Jesus hid himself, and went
out of the temple.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST CURING A MAN BORN BLIND, AND HIS PARABLE OF THE GOOD
SHEPHERD.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">9:1</sup>AND passing by he saw a
man that was blind from birth; <sup class="v">9:2</sup>and his
disciples asked him, saying, Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his
parents, that he was born blind? <sup class="v">9:3</sup>Jesus
answered, Neither did this man sin, nor his parents, but that the
works of God might appear in him. <sup class="v">9:4</sup>I must
perform the works of him that sent me, while it is day; night comes
when no man can work. <sup class="v">9:5</sup>While I am in the
world I am the light of the world. <sup class="v">9:6</sup>Saying
these things he spit on the ground, and made a paste of the
spittle, and put the paste on his eyes, <sup class="v">9:7</sup>and
said to him, Go, and wash in the pool of the Siloam; which is
interpreted, Sent. Then he went away and washed, and came
seeing.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">9:8</sup>Then the neighbors and
those who had seen him before, because he was a beggar, said, Is
not this he that sat and begged? <sup class="v">9:9</sup>Some said,
This is he; others said, No, but he is like him; he said, I am he.
<sup class="v">9:10</sup>Then they said to him, How then were your
eyes opened? <sup class="v">9:11</sup>He answered, A man called
Jesus made paste and anointed my eyes, and said to me, Go to the
Siloam and wash; then I went and washed, and obtained sight.
<sup class="v">9:12</sup>They said to him, Where is he? He said, I
know not.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">9:13</sup>They brought to the
Pharisees him that was formerly blind; <sup class="v">9:14</sup>and
it was on the sabbath when Jesus made the paste and opened his
eyes. <sup class="v">9:15</sup>Then the Pharisees also asked him
again how he obtained sight. And he said to them, He put a paste on
my eyes, and I washed, and see. <sup class="v">9:16</sup>Then some
of the Pharisees said, This man is not of God, for he does not keep
the sabbath. Others said, How can a sinful man perform such
miracles? And there was a division among them. <sup class=
"v">9:17</sup>They said to the blind man again, What do you say of
him, because he opened your eyes? And he said, He is a prophet.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">9:18</sup>Then the Jews did not
believe of him that he had been blind and received his sight, till
they called the parents of him that had received his sight.
<sup class="v">9:19</sup>And they asked them, saying, Is this your
son, of whom you say that he was born blind? How then does he now
see? <sup class="v">9:20</sup>His parents answered and said, We
know that this is our son, and that he was born blind; <sup class=
"v">9:21</sup>but how he now sees we know not, or who has opened
his eyes we know not; ask him, he is of age, he will speak for
himself. <sup class="v">9:22</sup>His parents said these things
because they feared the Jews; for already the Jews had agreed that
if any one confessed him to be Christ, he should be put out of the
synagogue; <sup class="v">9:23</sup>therefore his parents said, He
is of age, ask him.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">9:24</sup>Then they called the
man who had been blind, a second time, and said to him, Give glory
to God; we know that this man is a sinner. <sup class=
"v">9:25</sup>Then he answered, Whether he is a sinner I know not;
one thing I know, that having been blind, I now see. <sup class=
"v">9:26</sup>Then they said to him, What did he do to you? how did
he open your eyes? <sup class="v">9:27</sup>He answered them, I
have told you already, and you did not hear; why do you wish to
hear again? Do you also wish to be his disciples? <sup class=
"v">9:28</sup>They reproached him, and said, You are his disciple,
but we are disciples of Moses. <sup class="v">9:29</sup>We know
that God spoke to Moses, but we know not whence this man is.
<sup class="v">9:30</sup>The man answered and said to them, It is a
strange thing, that you know not whence he is, and he has opened my
eyes. <sup class="v">9:31</sup>We know that God hears not sinners;
but if one is a worshipper of God, and does his will, him he hears.
<sup class="v">9:32</sup>Since the world began it has not been
heard that any one opened the eyes of one born blind; <sup class=
"v">9:33</sup>unless this man was from God he would have been able
to do nothing. <sup class="v">9:34</sup>They answered and said to
him, You were born entirely in sins, and do you teach us? And they
cast him without.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">9:35</sup>Jesus heard that they
had cast him without, and finding him he said to him, Do you
believe in the Son of God? <sup class="v">9:36</sup>And he answered
and said, Who is he, sir, that I shall believe on him? <sup class=
"v">9:37</sup>Jesus said to him, You have both seen him, and he
that speaks to you is he. <sup class="v">9:38</sup>And he said,
Lord, I believe, and worshipped him. <sup class="v">9:39</sup>And
Jesus said, I came into this world for judgment, that those not
seeing may see, and those seeing become blind.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">9:40</sup>And the Pharisees who
were with him heard these things and said to him, Are we also
blind? <sup class="v">9:41</sup>Jesus said to them, If you were
blind you would not have had sin; but now you say, We see, your sin
remains. <sup class="v">10:1</sup>I tell you most truly, he that
enters not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbs in at some
other place, he is a thief and robber; <sup class="v">10:2</sup>but
he that enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.
<sup class="v">10:3</sup>To him the gate-keeper opens, and the
sheep hear his voice, and he calls his sheep by name, and leads
them out. <sup class="v">10:4</sup>When he puts out all his sheep
he goes before them, and the sheep follow him; for they know his
voice. <sup class="v">10:5</sup>But a stranger they will not
follow, but will flee from him, for they know not the voice of
strangers. <sup class="v">10:6</sup>This parable spoke Jesus to
them, but they knew not what the words which he spoke to them
meant.</p>
<p class="pin">8 <sup class="v">10:7</sup>Then said Jesus to them
again, I tell you most truly, I am the door of the sheep.
<sup class="v">10:8</sup>All who came before me are thieves and
robbers; but the sheep have not heard them. <sup class=
"v">10:9</sup>I am the door; by me if any one enters in he shall be
saved, and go in and out, and find pasturage. <sup class=
"v">10:10</sup>The thief comes not, except to steal, and kill, and
destroy; I came that they may have life, and have it
abundantly.</p>
<p class="pin">9 <sup class="v">10:11</sup>I am the good
shepherd. The good shepherd gives his life for the sheep.
<sup class="v">10:12</sup>But the hired servant, and one who is not
a shepherd, who does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming, and
leaves the sheep and flees, and the wolf seizes and scatters them;
<sup class="v">10:13</sup>for he is a hired servant and cares not
for the sheep. <sup class="v">10:14</sup>I am the good shepherd,
and I know mine and mine know me, <sup class="v">10:15</sup>as the
Father knows me and I know the Father; and I give my life for the
sheep.</p>
<p class="pin">10 <sup class="v">10:16</sup>And other sheep I
have which are not of this fold; and them I must lead, and they
shall hear my voice, and there shall be one flock, one shepherd.
<sup class="v">10:17</sup>Therefore my Father loves me, because I
lay down my life that I may take it again. <sup class=
"v">10:18</sup>No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of
myself. I have a right to lay it down, and I have a right to take
it again; this commandment have I received from my Father.
<sup class="v">10:19</sup>There was a division again among the Jews
on account of these words; <sup class="v">10:20</sup>and many of
them said, He has a demon, and is mad; why do you hear him?
<sup class="v">10:21</sup>Others said, These are not the words of a
demoniac; can a demon open the eyes of the blind?</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST AT THE FEAST OF THE DEDICATION, AND BEYOND THE
JORDAN.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">10:22</sup>IT was the dedication
at Jerusalem; it was winter; <sup class="v">10:23</sup>and Jesus
walked in the temple, in Solomon's porch. <sup class=
"v">10:24</sup>Then the Jews came around him and said to him, How
long do you hold our minds [in doubt]? If you are the Christ, tell
us plainly. <sup class="v">10:25</sup>Jesus answered them, I have
told you and you believe not; the works which I perform in my
Father's name, these testify of me; <sup class="v">10:26</sup>but
you believe not, because you are not of my sheep. As I said to you,
<sup class="v">10:27</sup>My sheep hear my voice and I know them,
and they follow me, <sup class="v">10:28</sup>and I give them
eternal life, and they shall never perish nor shall any one pluck
them out of my hand. <sup class="v">10:29</sup>My Father who gave
[them] to me is greater than all, and no one can pluck them out of
my Father's hand. <sup class="v">10:30</sup>I and the Father are
one.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">10:31</sup>Then the Jews took up
stones again to stone him. <sup class="v">10:32</sup>Jesus answered
them, Many good works have I shown you from the Father; for which
of these works do you stone me? <sup class="v">10:33</sup>The Jews
answered him, We do not stone you for a good work, but for
blasphemy, and because you, being a man, make yourself God.
<sup class="v">10:34</sup>Jesus answered them, Is it not written in
your law, I said you are gods? <sup class="v">10:35</sup>If he
called them gods to whom the word of God came, and the Scripture
cannot be broken, <sup class="v">10:36</sup>do you tell him whom
the Father has sanctified and sent into the world, You blaspheme,
because I said, I am the Son of God? <sup class="v">10:37</sup>If I
do not my Father's works, believe me not; <sup class=
"v">10:38</sup>but if I do, though you believe not me, believe the
works, that you may know and understand that the Father is in me
and I in the Father. <sup class="v">10:39</sup>Then they sought
again to take him by force; and he escaped out of their hand.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">10:40</sup>And he went away again
beyond the Jordan to the place where John first baptized, and
continued there. <sup class="v">10:41</sup>And many came to him and
said, John performed no miracle, but all things which John said of
this man were true. <sup class="v">10:42</sup>And many believed on
him there.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST RAISING LAZARUS FROM THE DEAD.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">11:1</sup>A CERTAIN man was sick,
Lazarus of Bethany, of the village of Mary and Martha her sister.
<sup class="v">11:2</sup>It was the Mary who anointed the Lord with
ointment and wiped his feet with her hairs, whose brother Lazarus
was sick. <sup class="v">11:3</sup>Then the sisters sent to him,
saying, Lord, behold, he whom you love is sick. <sup class=
"v">11:4</sup>But Jesus hearing it said, This sickness is not to
death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be
glorified by it. <sup class="v">11:5</sup>And Jesus loved Martha,
and her sister, and Lazarus. <sup class="v">11:6</sup>When,
therefore, he heard that he was sick, he continued in the place
where he was two days.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">11:7</sup>Then after that he said
to the disciples, Let us go again into Judea. <sup class=
"v">11:8</sup>The disciples said to him, Rabbi, the Jews lately
sought to stone you, and do you go there again? <sup class=
"v">11:9</sup>Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours of the
day? and if one walks in the day he does not stumble, because he
sees the light of this world; <sup class="v">11:10</sup>but if he
walks in the night he stumbles, because the light is not in it.
<sup class="v">11:11</sup>He said these things, and after this he
said to them, Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep; but I go that I
may awake him. <sup class="v">11:12</sup>Then they said to him,
Lord, if he has fallen asleep he will recover. <sup class=
"v">11:13</sup>But Jesus spoke of his death; but they thought that
he spoke of the rest of sleep. <sup class="v">11:14</sup>Then
Jesus, therefore, said to them plainly, Lazarus has died;
<sup class="v">11:15</sup>and I am glad for your sakes that I was
not there, that you may believe; but let us go to him. <sup class=
"v">11:16</sup>Then Thomas, who is called The twin, said to the
fellow disciples, Let us go also, that we may die with him.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">11:17</sup>Then Jesus coming
found that he had been four days in the tomb. <sup class=
"v">11:18</sup>And Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen
stadiums [1 3-4 miles] distant. <sup class="v">11:19</sup>And many
of the Jews came to those with Martha and Mary, to console them for
their brother. <sup class="v">11:20</sup>Then when Martha heard
that Jesus had come, she went out to meet him; but Mary sat in the
house. <sup class="v">11:21</sup>Then Martha said to Jesus, Lord,
if you had been here, my brother would not have died; <sup class=
"v">11:22</sup>but now also I know that whatever you ask of God,
God will give you. <sup class="v">11:23</sup>Jesus said to her,
Your brother shall rise again. <sup class="v">11:24</sup>Martha
said to him, I know that he will rise at the resurrection at the
last day. <sup class="v">11:25</sup>Jesus said to her, I am the
resurrection and the life; he that believes in me, even if he has
died, shall live, <sup class="v">11:26</sup>and no one who lives
and believes in me shall ever die; do you believe this? <sup class=
"v">11:27</sup>She said to him, Yes, Lord; I believe that you are
the Christ, the Son of God, who comes into the world.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">11:28</sup>And having said this
she went away and called Mary her sister, privately, saying, The
teacher has come and calls for you. <sup class="v">11:29</sup>When
she heard, she arose quickly and came to him; <sup class=
"v">11:30</sup>but Jesus had not yet entered into the village, but
was at the place where Martha met him. <sup class=
"v">11:31</sup>Then the Jews who were with her in the house and
consoling her, seeing Mary that she arose and went out quickly,
followed her, saying, She goes to the tomb to weep there.
<sup class="v">11:32</sup>Then Mary, when she came where Jesus was,
and saw him, fell down at his feet, saying to him, Lord, if you had
been here my brother would not have died.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">11:33</sup>Then when Jesus saw
her weeping, and the Jews weeping who came with her, he was greatly
agitated in spirit and affected, <sup class="v">11:34</sup>and
said, Where have you laid him? They said to him, Lord, come and
see. <sup class="v">11:35</sup>Jesus wept. <sup class=
"v">11:36</sup>Then the Jews said, Behold, how he loved him.
<sup class="v">11:37</sup>And some of them said, Could not this man
who opens the eyes of the blind, cause that even he should not have
died? <sup class="v">11:38</sup>Then Jesus again being agitated
within himself came to the tomb; it was a cave, and a stone lay
upon it. <sup class="v">11:39</sup>Jesus said, Take away the stone.
Martha, the sister of the dead, said to him, Lord, by this time he
smells; for he has been dead four days. <sup class=
"v">11:40</sup>Jesus said to her, Did I not tell you that if you
will believe you shall see the glory of God? <sup class=
"v">11:41</sup>Then they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted his
eyes above, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me;
<sup class="v">11:42</sup>and I knew that thou hearest me always;
but for the sake of the multitude who stand by I said it, that they
may believe that thou hast sent me. <sup class="v">11:43</sup>And
having said these things, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come
forth. <sup class="v">11:44</sup>And the dead came forth, bound as
to his feet and hands with bandages, and his face was bound with a
napkin. Jesus said to them, Unbind him, and let him go.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">11:45</sup>Then many of the Jews
who came with Mary, and saw what Jesus did, believed on him;
<sup class="v">11:46</sup>but some of them went away to the
Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">11:47</sup>Then the chief priests
and Pharisees convened the Sanhedrim, and said, What do we
accomplish? for this man performs many miracles. <sup class=
"v">11:48</sup>If we leave him thus all will believe on him; and
the Romans will come and take away our place and nation.
<sup class="v">11:49</sup>And one of them, Caiaphas, being chief
priest that year, said to them, You know nothing at all,
<sup class="v">11:50</sup>neither consider that it is expedient for
us that one man should die for the people, and not that all the
nation should perish. <sup class="v">11:51</sup>This he said not of
himself, but being chief priest that year he prophesied that Jesus
was about to die for the nation; <sup class="v">11:52</sup>and not
for the nation only, but to bring together into one [body] all the
children of God scattered abroad. <sup class="v">11:53</sup>From
that day, therefore, they took counsel to kill him.</p>
<p class="pin">8 <sup class="v">11:54</sup>Then Jesus walked no
more openly among the Jews, but went thence to a region near the
wilderness, to a city called Ephraim, and there he staid with his
disciples. <sup class="v">11:55</sup>And the passover of the Jews
was nigh, and many went up from the country to Jerusalem, before
the passover, to purify themselves. <sup class="v">11:56</sup>Then
they sought Jesus, and standing in the temple said one to another,
What do you think? that he will not come to the feast? <sup class=
"v">11:57</sup>And the chief priests and Pharisees had given
commandment, that if any one knew where he was he should make it
known, that they might take him by force.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST AT BETHANY, HIS TRIUMPHANT ENTRANCE INTO JERUSALEM,
ETC.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">12:1</sup>THEN Jesus, six days
before the passover, came to Bethany, where Lazarus was whom Jesus
had raised from the dead. <sup class="v">12:2</sup>Then they made
him a supper there, and Martha served; but Lazarus was one of those
that reclined with him. <sup class="v">12:3</sup>Then Mary taking a
pound of genuine nard, very costly, anointed the feet of Jesus, and
wiped his feet with her hairs. And the house was filled with the
odor of the ointment. <sup class="v">12:4</sup>But the Iscariot,
one of his disciples, who was about to betray him, said,
<sup class="v">12:5</sup>Why was not this ointment sold for three
hundred denarii [$42], and given to the poor? <sup class=
"v">12:6</sup>But he said this, not that he cared for the poor, but
because he was a thief, and had the treasure-chest, and carried off
the things put in it. <sup class="v">12:7</sup>Then Jesus said, Let
her alone, that she may keep this for the day of preparation for my
burial; <sup class="v">12:8</sup>the poor you always have with you,
but me you have not always.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">12:9</sup>A great multitude of
the Jews, therefore, knew that he was there, and came, not on
account of Jesus only, but also to see Lazarus whom he had raised
from the dead. <sup class="v">12:10</sup>And the chief priests took
counsel to kill Lazarus also, <sup class="v">12:11</sup>because
many of the Jews withdrew on his account and believed in Jesus.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">12:12</sup>On the next day a
great multitude having come to the feast, having heard that Jesus
was coming to Jerusalem, <sup class="v">12:13</sup>took branches of
palm trees, and went out to meet him, and cried, Hosanna, blessed
is he that comes in the name of the Lord, the King of Israel!
<sup class="v">12:14</sup>And Jesus finding a young ass sat on it,
as it is written; <sup class="v">12:15</sup>Fear not, Daughter of
Zion; behold, your King comes sitting on the colt of an ass.
<sup class="v">12:16</sup>His disciples did not understand these
things at first; but when Jesus was glorified then they remembered
that these things were written of him, and that they had done these
things to him. <sup class="v">12:17</sup>The multitude, therefore,
which was with him, testified that he called Lazarus from the tomb,
and raised him from the dead. <sup class="v">12:18</sup>On this
account also the multitude met him, because they heard that he had
performed this miracle. <sup class="v">12:19</sup>The Pharisees,
therefore, said among themselves, You see that you have gained
nothing; behold, the world has gone after him. <sup class=
"v">12:20</sup>And there were some Greeks of those who went up to
Jerusalem to worship at the feast; <sup class="v">12:21</sup>these,
therefore, came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and
asked him, saying, Sir, we wish to see Jesus. <sup class=
"v">12:22</sup>Philip went and told Andrew, and again Andrew and
Philip went and told Jesus. <sup class="v">12:23</sup>And Jesus
answered them, saying, The hour has come that the Son of man should
be glorified. <sup class="v">12:24</sup>I tell you most truly, that
unless the kernel of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it
continues alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit. <sup class=
"v">12:25</sup>He that loves his life shall lose it, and he that
hates his life in this world shall preserve it to eternal life.
<sup class="v">12:26</sup>If any man serves me let him follow me;
and where I am there also shall my servant be. If anyone serves me,
him will the Father honor. <sup class="v">12:27</sup>Now is my soul
troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour. But
for this cause came I to this hour; <sup class=
"v">12:28</sup>Father, glorify thy name. Then came a voice from
heaven, I have both glorified and will glorify it again.
<sup class="v">12:29</sup>Then the multitude standing and hearing,
said, It was thunder; others said, An angel spoke to him.
<sup class="v">12:30</sup>Jesus answered and said, This voice was
not on my account, but for you. <sup class="v">12:31</sup>There is
now a judgment of this world; the ruler of this world shall now be
cast out; <sup class="v">12:32</sup>and if I am raised on high from
the earth I will draw all men to me. <sup class="v">12:33</sup>But
this he said, signifying by what death he was about to die.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">12:34</sup>Then the multitude
answered him, We have heard from the law that the Christ continues
forever; and how say you, The Son of man must be raised on high?
Who is this Son of man? <sup class="v">12:35</sup>Then Jesus said
to them, Yet a little while is the light with you; walk while you
have the light, that darkness may not overtake you; for he that
walks in darkness knows not where he goes. <sup class=
"v">12:36</sup>While you have the light, believe in the light, that
you may be children of light. Jesus said these things, and went
away and concealed himself from them.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">12:37</sup>But though he had
performed so many miracles before them they did not believe in him;
<sup class="v">12:38</sup>that the word of Isaiah the prophet,
which he spoke, might be fulfilled; Lord, who has believed our
report? and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?
<sup class="v">12:39</sup>For this reason they could not believe,
because, Isaiah said again, <sup class="v">12:40</sup>He has
blinded their eyes, and hardened their hearts, that they should not
see with their eyes and understand with their hearts, and be
converted, and I should cure them. <sup class="v">12:41</sup>Isaiah
said these things because he saw his glory, and spoke of him.
<sup class="v">12:42</sup>Nevertheless, many of the rulers believed
on him, but on account of the Pharisees did not confess him, lest
they should be put out of the synagogues; <sup class=
"v">12:43</sup>for they loved the glory of men more than the glory
of God.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">12:44</sup>And Jesus cried and
said, He that believes on me, believes not on me but on him that
sent me; <sup class="v">12:45</sup>and he that beholds me beholds
him that sent me. <sup class="v">12:46</sup>I have come a light
into the world, that no one who believes in me should continue in
darkness. <sup class="v">12:47</sup>And if any one hears my words
and keeps them not, I do not judge him; for I came not to judge the
world but to save the world. <sup class="v">12:48</sup>He that
rejects me and receives not my words, has one that judges him; the
word which I have spoken, that shall judge him at the last day.
<sup class="v">12:49</sup>For I have not spoken of myself; but the
Father who sent me gave me commandment what to say and what to
speak; <sup class="v">12:50</sup>and I know that his commandment is
eternal life. What things I speak, therefore, I so speak as the
Father has told me.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST AT THE LAST SUPPER, AND HIS SERMON TO THE ELEVEN.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">13:1</sup>AND before the feast of
the passover, Jesus knowing that his hour had come to depart from
this world to the Father, having loved his own in the world he
loved them to the end. <sup class="v">13:2</sup>And supper being
over, the devil having already put it in the heart that Judas
Iscariot, the son of Simon, should betray him, <sup class=
"v">13:3</sup>he knowing that the Father had given all things into
his hands, and that he came from God and was going to God,
<sup class="v">13:4</sup>arose from supper, and laid aside his
clothes, and taking a towel girded himself: <sup class=
"v">13:5</sup>Then he put water into the wash-basin, and began to
wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel with
which he was girded.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">13:6</sup>Then he came to Simon
Peter; he said to him, Lord, do you wash my feet? <sup class=
"v">13:7</sup>Jesus answered and said to him, What I do you know
not now, but you shall know hereafter. <sup class=
"v">13:8</sup>Peter said to him, You shall never by any means wash
my feet. He answered him, Unless I wash you you have no part with
me. <sup class="v">13:9</sup>Simon Peter said to him, Lord, not my
feet only, but my hands and my head. <sup class=
"v">13:10</sup>Jesus said to him, He that is washed needs only that
his feet should be washed, but is wholly pure; and you are pure,
but not all. <sup class="v">13:11</sup>For he knew him that was to
betray him; therefore, he said, You are not all pure.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">13:12</sup>When, therefore, he
had washed their feet, and taken his clothes and sat down again, he
said to them, Do you know what I have done to you? <sup class=
"v">13:13</sup>You call me Teacher and Lord; and you say well, for
I am. <sup class="v">13:14</sup>If I then, the Lord and the
Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one
another's feet. <sup class="v">13:15</sup>For I have given you an
example, that you also should do as I have done. <sup class=
"v">13:16</sup>I tell you most truly, the servant is not greater
than his lord, nor the apostle greater than he that sent him.
<sup class="v">13:17</sup>If you know these things, blessed are you
if you do them. <sup class="v">13:18</sup>I speak not of you all; I
know whom I have chosen; but that the Scripture may be fulfilled,
He that eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against me.
<sup class="v">13:19</sup>I tell you from this time, before it
occurs, that when it occurs you may believe that I am [the Christ].
<sup class="v">13:20</sup>I tell you most truly, He that receives
one that I send receives me; and he that receives me receives him
that sent me.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">13:21</sup>Having said these
things Jesus was troubled in spirit, and testified and said, I tell
you most truly, that one of you shall betray me. <sup class=
"v">13:22</sup>The disciples looked one on another, doubting of
whom he spoke. <sup class="v">13:23</sup>One of his disciples, whom
Jesus loved, was reclining on the bosom of Jesus. <sup class=
"v">13:24</sup>Then Simon Peter made signs to this man, and said to
him, Ask who it is of whom he speaks. <sup class="v">13:25</sup>He,
falling down on the breast of Jesus, said to him, Lord, who is it?
<sup class="v">13:26</sup>Then Jesus answered, It is he to whom I
will dip and give the mouthful. Then dipping the mouthful, he took
and gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot. <sup class=
"v">13:27</sup>And after the mouthful, then Satan entered into him.
Then Jesus said to him, What you do, do quickly. <sup class=
"v">13:28</sup>No one of those reclining knew for what purpose he
said this to him, <sup class="v">13:29</sup>for some thought, since
Judas had the treasure-chest, that Jesus said to him, Buy what we
need for the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.
<sup class="v">13:30</sup>He, therefore, having taken the mouthful,
immediately went out; and it was night.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">13:31</sup>When he had gone out
Jesus said, Now the Son of man has been glorified, and God has been
glorified in him. <sup class="v">13:32</sup>If God has been
glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself, and will
immediately glorify him. <sup class="v">13:33</sup>My little
children, I am with you yet a little while. You shall seek me, and
as I said to the Jews, Where I go you cannot come, I now also say
to you. <sup class="v">13:34</sup>I give you a new commandment to
love another, as I have loved you that you also should love one
another. <sup class="v">13:35</sup>By this shall all know that you
are my disciples, if you have love one for another. <sup class=
"v">13:36</sup>Simon Peter said to him, Lord, where do you go?
Jesus answered Where I go you cannot follow me now, but you shall
follow afterwards. <sup class="v">13:37</sup>Peter said to him,
Lord, why can I not follow you now? I will lay down my life for
you. <sup class="v">13:38</sup>Jesus answered, Will you lay down
your life for me? I tell you most truly, a cock shall not crow till
you shall deny me thrice.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">14:1</sup>Let not your hearts be
troubled; believe in God and believe in me. <sup class=
"v">14:2</sup>In my Father's house are many mansions; if there were
not I would have told you. <sup class="v">14:3</sup>For I go to
prepare a place for you; and if I go and shall prepare a place for
you, I will come again and receive you to myself, that where I am
you may also be. <sup class="v">14:4</sup>And where I go, you know
the way. <sup class="v">14:5</sup>Thomas said to him, Lord, we know
not where you go, and how do we know the way? <sup class=
"v">14:6</sup>Jesus said to him, I am the way, and the truth, and
the life. No one comes to the Father except by me. <sup class=
"v">14:7</sup>If you had known me you would have known my Father;
and from this time you know him and have seen him.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">14:8</sup>Philip said to him,
Lord, show us the Father, and we shall be satisfied. <sup class=
"v">14:9</sup>Jesus said to him, Have I been so long a time with
you and have you not known me, Philip? He that has seen me has seen
the Father; and how say you, Show us the Father? <sup class=
"v">14:10</sup>Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the
Father in me? The words which I speak to you I speak not of myself,
but the Father continuing in me, he does the works. <sup class=
"v">14:11</sup>Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father in
me; but if not, believe on account of the works themselves.
<sup class="v">14:12</sup>I tell you most truly, he that believes
on me, the works that I do shall he do; and greater works than
these shall he do, because I go to the Father; <sup class=
"v">14:13</sup>and whatever you ask in my name I will do, that the
Father may be glorified in the Son. <sup class="v">14:14</sup>If
you shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.</p>
<p class="pin">8 <sup class="v">14:15</sup>If you love me, keep
my commandments; <sup class="v">14:16</sup>and I will pray the
Father, and he will give you another Comforter, to be with you
forever, <sup class="v">14:17</sup>the Spirit of truth, which the
world cannot receive, because it beholds it not nor knows it; but
you know it, because it continues with you, and shall be in you.
<sup class="v">14:18</sup>I will not leave you orphans; I will come
to you. <sup class="v">14:19</sup>Yet a little while and the world
beholds me no more; but you shall behold me; because I live, you
shall live also. <sup class="v">14:20</sup>In that day you shall
know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you.
<sup class="v">14:21</sup>He that has my commandments and keeps
them, he it is that loves me; and he that loves me shall be loved
by my Father, and I will love him and manifest myself to him.</p>
<p class="pin">9 <sup class="v">14:22</sup>Judas said to him, not
the Iscariot, Lord, and how is it that you are about to manifest
yourself to us, and not to the world? <sup class=
"v">14:23</sup>Jesus answered and said to him, If any one loves me
he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come
to him, and make our mansion with him. <sup class="v">14:24</sup>He
that loves me not, keeps not my words; and the word which you hear
is not mine, but the Father's that sent me.</p>
<p class="pin">10 <sup class="v">14:25</sup>I have said these
things to you while yet continuing with you, <sup class=
"v">14:26</sup>but the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, which the Father
will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and remind you
of all things which I have told you. <sup class=
"v">14:27</sup>Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you; not as
the world gives give I to you. Let not your hearts be troubled,
neither let them be afraid. <sup class="v">14:28</sup>You heard
that I said to you, I will go away and come to you. If you loved me
you would rejoice because I go to the Father, for the Father is
greater than I. <sup class="v">14:29</sup>And now I have told you
before it occurs, that when it occurs you may believe. <sup class=
"v">14:30</sup>I will not speak with you much more; for the ruler
of this world comes and has nothing in me; <sup class=
"v">14:31</sup>but [I have said this] that the world may know that
I love the Father, and that as the Father has commanded me, so I
do. Arise, let us go hence.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST'S SERMON AFTER THE LAST SUPPER.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">15:1</sup>I am the true vine, and
my Father is the husbandman. <sup class="v">15:2</sup>Every branch
in me that bears not fruit he takes away; and every branch that
bears fruit he trims, that it may bear more fruit. <sup class=
"v">15:3</sup>You are now pure, by means of the word which I have
spoken to you; <sup class="v">15:4</sup>continue in me, and I in
you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it continues
in the vine, so you cannot, unless you continue in me. <sup class=
"v">15:5</sup>I am the vine, you are the branches. He that
continues in me and I in him, this man bears much fruit; for
separated from me, you can do nothing. <sup class="v">15:6</sup>If
any one continues not in me he is cast without as a branch, and is
withered; and they collect them and cast them into the fire, and
they are burned. <sup class="v">15:7</sup>If you continue in me,
and my words continue in you, you shall ask whatever you will, and
it shall be [given] you. <sup class="v">15:8</sup>By this is my
Father glorified, that you bear much fruit and be my disciples.
<sup class="v">15:9</sup>As the Father has loved me, I also have
loved you; continue in my love. <sup class="v">15:10</sup>If you
keep my commandments you shall continue in my love, as I have kept
my Father's commandments and continue in his love. <sup class=
"v">15:11</sup>I have spoken these things to you that my joy may be
in you, and your joy be completed. <sup class="v">15:12</sup>This
is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you.
<sup class="v">15:13</sup>No man has greater love than this, that
one should give his life for his friends. <sup class=
"v">15:14</sup>You are my friends if you do what I command you;
<sup class="v">15:15</sup>I no longer call you servants, for the
servant knows not what his Lord does; but I have called you
friends: for all things which I have heard from my Father I have
made known to you. <sup class="v">15:16</sup>You have not chosen
me, but I have chosen you, and appointed you to go and bear fruit,
and that your fruit should continue, that whatever you ask the
Father in my name he may give you. <sup class="v">15:17</sup>These
things I charge you, that you love one another.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">15:18</sup>If the world hates
you, you know that it hated me before you. <sup class=
"v">15:19</sup>If you were of this world, the world would be a
friend to its own; but because you are not of the world, but I have
chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.
<sup class="v">15:20</sup>Remember the word which I said to you, a
servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me,
they will also persecute you; if they have kept my word, they will
also keep yours. <sup class="v">15:21</sup>But all these things
they will do to you, on my account, because they know not him that
sent me. <sup class="v">15:22</sup>If I had not come and spoken to
them, they would not have had sin; but now they have no pretext for
their sin. <sup class="v">15:23</sup>He that hates me, hates my
Father also. <sup class="v">15:24</sup>If I had not done among them
the works which no other one has done, they would not have had sin;
but now they have both seen and hated both me and my Father.
<sup class="v">15:25</sup>But [they do this] that the word written
in their law may be fulfilled, They hated me without cause.
<sup class="v">15:26</sup>But when the Comforter has come, whom I
will send you from the Father, the Spirit of truth which proceeds
from the Father, he shall testify of me; <sup class=
"v">15:27</sup>and you shall also testify, because you have been
with me from the beginning.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">16:1</sup>These things I have
said to you, that you may not be offended. <sup class=
"v">16:2</sup>They shall put you out of the synagogues; but the
hour is coming when every one that kills you will think he renders
God a service. <sup class="v">16:3</sup>And these things they will
do, because they have not known the Father nor me. <sup class=
"v">16:4</sup>But these things I have told you, that when the time
comes you may remember that I told you of them. But I told you not
these things at the beginning, because I was with you. <sup class=
"v">16:5</sup>But now I go to him that sent me, and no one of you
asks me, Where do you go? <sup class="v">16:6</sup>But because I
have said these things to you, sorrow has filled your hearts.
<sup class="v">16:7</sup>But I tell you the truth; it is expedient
for you that I should go away; for if I do not go away, the
Comforter will not come to you; but if I go I will send him to you.
<sup class="v">16:8</sup>And when he has come, he will convince the
world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment: <sup class=
"v">16:9</sup>of sin, because they believe not on me; <sup class=
"v">16:10</sup>and of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and
you behold me no more; <sup class="v">16:11</sup>and of judgment,
because the ruler of this world has been judged.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">16:12</sup>I have many things yet
to say to you, but you cannot bear them now; <sup class=
"v">16:13</sup>but when he, the Spirit of truth has come, he will
lead you in all the truth; for he will not speak of himself, but he
will speak whatever he shall hear, and tell you things to come.
<sup class="v">16:14</sup>He shall glorify me, because he shall
receive from me and tell you. <sup class="v">16:15</sup>All things
that the Father has, are mine; on this account I said, He shall
receive of me and tell you.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">16:16</sup>A little while and you
shall not see me; and again a little while and you shall see me.
<sup class="v">16:17</sup>Then some of his disciples said one to
another, What is this that he says to us, A little while and you
shall not see me, and again a little while and you shall see me?
and, Because I go to the Father? <sup class="v">16:18</sup>They
said therefore, What is this that he says, The little while? We do
not know what he says.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">16:19</sup>Jesus knew that they
wished to ask him, and said to them, Do you inquire among
yourselves concerning this that I said, A little while and you
shall not see me, and again a little while and you shall see me?
<sup class="v">16:20</sup>I tell you most truly, that you shall
weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice; and you shall be
sorrowful, but your sorrow shall become joy. <sup class=
"v">16:21</sup>For when a woman is in labor she has pain, because
her time has come; but when she has borne the child she no longer
remembers the distress, because of joy that a man is born into the
world. <sup class="v">16:22</sup>And you therefore now indeed have
sorrow; but I will see you again, and your hearts shall rejoice,
and your joy no one shall take from you. <sup class=
"v">16:23</sup>And in that day you shall ask me nothing; I tell you
most truly, whatever you shall ask the Father, he will give you in
my name. <sup class="v">16:24</sup>Till now you have asked nothing
in my name; ask and you shall receive, that your joy may be
complete.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">16:25</sup>These things have I
spoken to you in parables. The time is coming when I will no more
speak to you in parables, but I will tell you plainly of the
Father. <sup class="v">16:26</sup>In that day you shall ask in my
name, and I tell you not that I will ask the Father for you;
<sup class="v">16:27</sup>for the Father himself is a friend to
you, because you have been friends to me, and believed that I came
forth from God. <sup class="v">16:28</sup>I came forth from the
Father and have come into the world; again I leave the world and go
to the Father.</p>
<p class="pin">8 <sup class="v">16:29</sup>Then his disciples
said to him, Behold, now you speak plainly, and say no parable;
<sup class="v">16:30</sup>now we know that you know all things, and
have no need that any one should ask you; on this account we
believe that you have come forth from God. <sup class=
"v">16:31</sup>Jesus answered them, Do you now believe? <sup class=
"v">16:32</sup>Behold, the time is coming, and has come, that you
shall be scattered every one to his own, and leave me alone; and I
am not alone, for the Father is with me. <sup class=
"v">16:33</sup>These things have I told you, that in me you may
have peace. In the world you shall have affliction; but be of good
courage, I have overcome the world.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST'S PRAYER FOR HIS DISCIPLES.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">17:1</sup>JESUS spoke these words
and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour has
come; glorify thy Son, that the Son may glorify thee, <sup class=
"v">17:2</sup>as thou hast given him power over all flesh, that as
to all that thou hast given him he should give them eternal life.
<sup class="v">17:3</sup>And this is the eternal life; that they
shall know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast
sent. <sup class="v">17:4</sup>I have glorified thee on the earth;
I have finished the work which thou gayest me to do. <sup class=
"v">17:5</sup>And now glorify thou me, Father, with thyself, with
the glory which I had with thee before the world was.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">17:6</sup>I have manifested thy
name to the men whom thou gayest me out of the world; they were
thine, and thou gavest them me, and they have kept thy word.
<sup class="v">17:7</sup>Now they have known that all things which
thou hast given me are of thee, <sup class="v">17:8</sup>because
the words which thou hast given me I have given them; and they have
received and known truly that I came forth from thee, and believed
that thou didst send me. <sup class="v">17:9</sup>I pray for them.
I pray not for the world, but for those whom thou hast given me,
for they are thine, <sup class="v">17:10</sup>and all mine are
thine, and thine mine, and I am glorified in them. <sup class=
"v">17:11</sup>And I am no longer in the world, and these are in
the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep in thy name those
whom thou hast given me, that they may be one as we also are.
<sup class="v">17:12</sup>When I was with them in the world, I kept
them in thy name which thou gayest me, and preserved [them], and no
one of them has been lost, except the son of perdition, that the
Scripture might be fulfilled; <sup class="v">17:13</sup>but now I
come to thee, and I say these things in the world that they may
have my joy made complete in them.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">17:14</sup>I have given them thy
word, and the world has hated them because they are not of the
world, as I am not of the world. <sup class="v">17:15</sup>I ask
not that thou wouldst take them out of the world, but that thou
wouldst keep them from evil. <sup class="v">17:16</sup>They are not
of the world, as I am not of the world. <sup class=
"v">17:17</sup>Sanctify them by thy truth; thy word is truth.
<sup class="v">17:18</sup>As thou hast sent me into the world, I
also have sent them into the world: <sup class="v">17:19</sup>and I
sanctify myself for them, that they also may be sanctified by
truth.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">17:20</sup>And I ask not for
these only, but for those also who shall believe on me through
their word, <sup class="v">17:21</sup>that all may be one, as thou,
Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us,
that the world may believe that thou hast sent me. <sup class=
"v">17:22</sup>And the glory which thou hast given me I have given
them, that they may be one as we are one, <sup class=
"v">17:23</sup>I in them, and thou in me, that they may be
perfected into one, that the world may know that thou hast sent me
and hast loved them as thou hast loved me. <sup class=
"v">17:24</sup>Father, what thou hast given me, I will that they
should be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory which
thou hast given me; because thou didst love me before the
foundation of the world; <sup class="v">17:25</sup>and, righteous
Father, the world has not known thee, but I have known thee, and
these have known that thou didst send me. <sup class=
"v">17:26</sup>And I have declared to them thy name, and will
declare it, that the love with which thou hast loved me may be in
them, as I also am in them.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>
<h3>THE APPREHENSION OF CHRIST, HIS EXAMINATION BY THE JEWS,
PETER'S DENIAL OF HIM.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">18:1</sup>JESUS having said these
words went out with his disciples across the brook Cedron, where
there was a garden, into which he entered and his disciples.
<sup class="v">18:2</sup>And Judas who betrayed him knew the place,
for Jesus often retired there with his disciples. <sup class=
"v">18:3</sup>Then Judas taking the guard and the officers of the
chief priests and Pharisees, came there with torches, and lamps,
and weapons. <sup class="v">18:4</sup>Jesus, therefore, knowing all
things that were coming upon him, went out and said to them, Whom
do you seek? <sup class="v">18:5</sup>They answered him, Jesus the
Nazoraean. Jesus said to them, I am he. And Judas who betrayed him
stood with them. <sup class="v">18:6</sup>When, therefore, he said
to them, I am he, they went backwards and fell on the ground.
<sup class="v">18:7</sup>Then he asked them again, Whom do you
seek? And they said, Jesus, the Nazoraean. <sup class=
"v">18:8</sup>Jesus answered, I told you that I am he; if,
therefore, you seek me, let these go; <sup class="v">18:9</sup>that
the word might be fulfilled which he said, Of those whom thou
gayest me I have lost none. <sup class="v">18:10</sup>Then Simon
Peter having a sword drew it and struck the servant of the chief
priest, and cut off his right ear; and the name of the servant was
Malchus. <sup class="v">18:11</sup>Then Jesus said to Peter, Put
the sword in the sheath. The cup which the Father has given me,
shall I not drink it?</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">18:12</sup>Then the guard and the
chiliarch and the officers of the Jews apprehended Jesus, and bound
him, <sup class="v">18:13</sup>and led him away to Annas first; for
he was father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was chief priest that year;
<sup class="v">18:14</sup>and Caiaphas was the one who advised the
Jews that it was expedient that one man should be destroyed for the
people.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">18:15</sup>But Simon Peter
followed Jesus, and the other disciple; and that disciple was known
to the chief priest, and went in with Jesus to the chief priest's
court; <sup class="v">18:16</sup>but Peter stood at the door
without. Then the other disciple who was known to the chief priest
went out and spoke to the door-keeper, and brought in Peter.
<sup class="v">18:17</sup>Then the female servant, the door-keeper,
said to Peter, Are you also one of the disciples of this man? He
said, I am not. <sup class="v">18:18</sup>And the servants and
officers having made a fire because it was cold, stood and warmed
themselves. And Peter stood with them and warmed himself.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">18:19</sup>Then the chief priest
asked Jesus of his disciples, and his teaching. <sup class=
"v">18:20</sup>Jesus answered him, I have spoken openly to the
world; I always taught in a synagogue, and in the temple, where the
Jews always assemble, and in secret I have said nothing.
<sup class="v">18:21</sup>Why do you ask me? Ask those who have
heard me, what I said to them; behold, they know what I said.
<sup class="v">18:22</sup>He having said these things, one of the
officers who stood by gave Jesus a blow, saying, Do you answer the
chief priest thus? <sup class="v">18:23</sup>Jesus answered him, If
I spoke wrong, testify of the wrong; but if well, why do you beat
me? <sup class="v">18:24</sup>Then Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas
the chief priest.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">18:25</sup>And Simon Peter was
standing and warming himself. Then they said to him, Are you also
one of his disciples? He denied, and said, I am not. <sup class=
"v">18:26</sup>One of the servants of the chief priest, being a
relation of him whose ear Peter cut off, said, Did I not see you in
the garden with him? <sup class="v">18:27</sup>Then Peter denied
again; and immediately a cock crew.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST'S TRIAL AND CONDEMNATION BEFORE PILATE.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">18:28</sup>THEN they led him from
Caiaphas to the Pr&aelig;torium. And it was morning; and they
entered not into the Pr&aelig;torium, that they might not be
defiled, but might eat the passover. <sup class="v">18:29</sup>Then
Pilate went out to them and said, What accusation do you bring
against this man? <sup class="v">18:30</sup>They answered and said
to him, If he was not a criminal we should not have delivered him
up to you. <sup class="v">18:31</sup>Then Pilate said to them, Take
him yourselves, and judge him according to your law. The Jews said
to him, It is not lawful for us to put any one to death;
<sup class="v">18:32</sup>that the word of Jesus might be
fulfilled, which he spoke, signifying by what death he was about to
die.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">18:33</sup>Then Pilate went into
the Pr&aelig;torium and called Jesus, and said to him, Are you the
king of the Jews? <sup class="v">18:34</sup>Jesus answered, Do you
say this of yourself, or did others tell you of me? <sup class=
"v">18:35</sup>Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Your nation and the
chief priests have delivered you to me; what have you done?
<sup class="v">18:36</sup>Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this
world. If my kingdom had been of this world my officers would have
fought for me, that I should not be given up to the Jews; but now
my kingdom is not here. <sup class="v">18:37</sup>Then Pilate said
to him, Are you a king then? Jesus answered, As you say, I am a
king. For this was I born, and for this I came into the world, that
I should testify to the truth; every one who is of the truth hears
my voice. <sup class="v">18:38</sup>Pilate said to him, What is
truth? And having said this he went out again to the Jews, and said
to them, I find no fault in him. <sup class="v">18:39</sup>But you
have a custom that I should release one to you at the passover; are
you willing, therefore, that I should release to you the king of
the Jews? <sup class="v">18:40</sup>Then all cried again, saying,
Not this man, but Barabbas. But Barabbas was a robber.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">19:1</sup>Then Pilate took and
scourged Jesus. <sup class="v">19:2</sup>And the soldiers having
plaited a crown of thorns put it on his head; and they put a purple
garment about him, <sup class="v">19:3</sup>and came to him and
said, Hail, king of the Jews! And they struck him with the open
hand. <sup class="v">19:4</sup>Then Pilate came out again and said
to them, Behold, I bring him out to you, that you may know that I
find no fault in him. <sup class="v">19:5</sup>Then Jesus came out,
wearing the thorny crown and the purple garment. And he said to
them, Behold the man! <sup class="v">19:6</sup>When therefore the
chief priests and officers saw him, they cried, saying, Crucify
him! crucify him! Pilate said to them, Take him yourselves and
crucify him, for I find no fault in him. <sup class=
"v">19:7</sup>The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law
he ought to die because he made himself the Son of God.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">19:8</sup>When therefore Pilate
heard this charge he was more afraid, <sup class="v">19:9</sup>and
entered into the Pr&aelig;torium again, and said to Jesus, Whence
are you? But Jesus gave him no answer. <sup class=
"v">19:10</sup>Pilate said to him, Do you not speak to me? Do you
not know that I have power to release you, and I have power to
crucify you? <sup class="v">19:11</sup>Jesus answered, You would
have had no power against me if it had not been given you from
above; therefore he that delivered me to you has a greater sin.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">19:12</sup>From that time Pilate
sought to release him; but the Jews cried, saying, If you release
this man you are not a friend of C&aelig;sar; every one who makes
himself a king speaks against C&aelig;sar. <sup class=
"v">19:13</sup>Then Pilate hearing these words led Jesus out, and
sat on the tribunal, in a place called the Pavement, but in Hebrew,
Gabbatha. <sup class="v">19:14</sup>And it was the preparation of
the passover, it was about the sixth hour [noon]; and he said to
the Jews, Behold your king! <sup class="v">19:15</sup>Then they
cried out, Away with him, away with him! crucify him! Pilate said
to them, Shall I crucify your king? The chief priests answered, We
have no king but C&aelig;sar. <sup class="v">19:16</sup>Then
therefore he delivered him to them to be crucified.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST'S CRUCIFIXION, DEATH, AND BURIAL.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">19:17</sup>THEN they took Jesus,
and putting the cross on him he went out to what is called the
place of a cranium, which in Hebrew is called Golgotha, <sup class=
"v">19:18</sup>where they crucified him, and two others with him,
one on one side and the other on the other, and Jesus between.
<sup class="v">19:19</sup>And Pilate wrote an inscription and put
on the cross. And it was written, JESUS THE NAZOR&AElig;AN, THE
KING OF THE JEWS. <sup class="v">19:20</sup>Many of the Jews
therefore read this inscription, because the place where Jesus was
crucified was nigh the city; and it was written in Hebrew, Latin,
and Greek. <sup class="v">19:21</sup>Then the chief priests of the
Jews said to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews, but that he
said, I am King of the Jews. <sup class="v">19:22</sup>Pilate
answered, what I have written I have written.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">19:23</sup>Then the soldiers,
when they crucified Jesus, took his clothes and made four parts, a
part to each soldier, and his coat. But his coat was without seam,
woven from the top through the whole. <sup class=
"v">19:24</sup>They said, therefore, one to another, Let us not
divide this, but cast lots for it whose it shall be; that the
Scripture might be fulfilled, which says, They parted my garments
among them, and for my clothing they cast lots. The soldiers
therefore did indeed these things.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">19:25</sup>And there stood by the
cross of Jesus, his mother, and the sister of his mother, Mary the
wife of Cleopas, and Mary the Magdalene. <sup class=
"v">19:26</sup>Then Jesus seeing his mother, and the disciple
standing by whom he loved, said to his mother, Woman, behold your
son. <sup class="v">19:27</sup>Then he said to the disciple, Behold
your mother. And from that hour the disciple took her to his own
[house].</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">19:28</sup>After this, Jesus
knowing that all things were already finished, that the Scripture
might be fully accomplished, said, I thirst. <sup class=
"v">19:29</sup>Then a vessel was set full of vinegar; and filling a
sponge with vinegar, and putting it on a hyssop stalk, they
presented it to his mouth. <sup class="v">19:30</sup>When therefore
Jesus took the vinegar, he said, It is finished; and inclining his
head gave up the spirit.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">19:31</sup>Then the Jews, that
the bodies might not continue on the cross on the sabbath, for it
was the preparation, for that was a great sabbath, asked Pilate
that their legs might be broken and they be taken down. <sup class=
"v">19:32</sup>Then the soldiers came and broke the legs of the
first and of the other crucified with him, <sup class=
"v">19:33</sup>and coming to Jesus, when they saw him already dead,
they broke not his legs; <sup class="v">19:34</sup>but one of the
soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and immediately there came
out blood and water. <sup class="v">19:35</sup>He who saw has
testified, and his testimony is true, for he knows that he says
what is true, that you also may believe. <sup class=
"v">19:36</sup>For these things were done that the Scripture might
be fulfilled, Not a bone of him shall be broken; <sup class=
"v">19:37</sup>and again another Scripture says, They shall look on
him whom they have pierced.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">19:38</sup>After these things
Joseph from Arimathea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for
fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take down the body of
Jesus; and Pilate permitted him. Then he came and took his body.
<sup class="v">19:39</sup>And Nicodemus, who at first came to Jesus
by night, also came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a
hundred pounds. <sup class="v">19:40</sup>Then they took the body
of Jesus, and bound it with bandages, with the spices, as the
custom of the Jews is to prepare for burial. <sup class=
"v">19:41</sup>And there was in the place where he was crucified a
garden, and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one was yet laid.
<sup class="v">19:42</sup>In that therefore they laid Jesus, on
account of the preparation of the Jews, because the tomb was
near.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST AFTER THE RESURRECTION.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">20:1</sup>AND on the first day of
the week, Mary the Magdalene came in the morning, while it was yet
dark, to the tomb and saw the stone taken away from the tomb.
<sup class="v">20:2</sup>Then she ran and came to Simon Peter, and
to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and said to them, They have
taken away the Lord from the tomb, and we know not where they have
laid him. <sup class="v">20:3</sup>Then went Peter and the other
disciple, and came to the tomb. <sup class="v">20:4</sup>And the
two ran together; and the other disciple outran Peter and came
first to the tomb, <sup class="v">20:5</sup>and stooping down saw
the bandages lying, but he went not in. <sup class=
"v">20:6</sup>Then Simon Peter came following him, and went into
the tomb, and beheld the bandages lying, <sup class=
"v">20:7</sup>and the napkin which was on his head not lying with
the bandages but folded up in a place by itself. <sup class=
"v">20:8</sup>Then the other disciple who came first to the tomb
also entered in, and saw and believed; <sup class="v">20:9</sup>for
they did not yet know the Scripture, that he must rise from the
dead. <sup class="v">20:10</sup>Then the disciples went away by
themselves.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">20:11</sup>But Mary stood at the
tomb outside, weeping. Then as she wept she stooped down to the
tomb, <sup class="v">20:12</sup>and saw two angels in white sitting
one at the head and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus
had lain. <sup class="v">20:13</sup>And they said to her, Woman,
why do you weep? She said to them, Because they have taken my Lord
and I know not where they have laid him. <sup class=
"v">20:14</sup>Having said these words she turned around and beheld
Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus. <sup class=
"v">20:15</sup>Jesus said to her, Woman, why do you weep? whom do
you seek? She, supposing that he was the gardener, said to him,
Sir, if you have borne him away, tell me where you have laid him,
and I will take him. <sup class="v">20:16</sup>Jesus said to her,
Mary. She, turning around, said to him in Hebrew, Rabboni, which is
interpreted, Teacher. <sup class="v">20:17</sup>Jesus said to her,
Do not touch me; for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go
to my brothers and tell them, I ascend to my Father and your
Father, and my God and your God. <sup class="v">20:18</sup>Mary the
Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord,
and that he said these things to her.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">20:19</sup>Then when it was
evening, on that first day of the week, and the doors were shut
where the disciples were for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood
in the midst, and said to them, Peace be to you. <sup class=
"v">20:20</sup>And having said this he showed them both his hands
and his side; then the disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord.
<sup class="v">20:21</sup>Then he said to them again, Peace be to
you; as the Father has sent me, I also send you. <sup class=
"v">20:22</sup>And having said this he breathed on them, and said
to them, Receive the Holy Spirit. <sup class="v">20:23</sup>Those
whose sins you forgive, are forgiven; and whose you retain, are
retained.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">20:24</sup>But Thomas, one of the
twelve, called the Twin, was not with them when Jesus came.
<sup class="v">20:25</sup>Then the other disciples said to him, We
have seen the Lord; but he said to them, Unless I see in his hands
the impression of the nails, and put my finger in the impression of
the nails, and put my hand in his side, I will not believe.
<sup class="v">20:26</sup>And after eight days his disciples were
again within, and Thomas with them. Jesus came, the doors being
shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be to you.
<sup class="v">20:27</sup>Then he said to Thomas, Reach here your
finger and behold my hands, and reach your hand and put it in my
side, and be not faithless but believing. <sup class=
"v">20:28</sup>Thomas answered and said to him, My Lord and my God.
<sup class="v">20:29</sup>Jesus said to him, Because you have seen
me you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and
believed.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">20:30</sup>Jesus performed also
many other miracles in the presence of his disciples which are not
recorded in this book; <sup class="v">20:31</sup>but these are
recorded that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of
God, and that believing you may have life in his name.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">21:1</sup>After these things he
showed himself again to the disciples at the lake of Tiberias; and
he showed himself thus. <sup class="v">21:2</sup>Simon Peter, and
Thomas called the Twin, and Nathaniel who was from Cana in Galilee,
and the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples were
together. <sup class="v">21:3</sup>Simon Peter said to them, I am
going a fishing. They said to him, We will also go with you. They
went out and entered into the ship; and on that night caught
nothing, <sup class="v">21:4</sup>but when it was now morning Jesus
stood on the shore; but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.
<sup class="v">21:5</sup>Then Jesus said to them, Children, have
you any thing to eat? They answered him, No. <sup class=
"v">21:6</sup>And he said to them, Cast the net on the right side
of the ship and you shall find. Then they cast it, and they were
not able to draw it from the number of fishes. <sup class=
"v">21:7</sup>Then that disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, It
is the Lord. Then Simon Peter, hearing that it was the Lord, girded
on his coat, for he was naked, and cast himself into the lake.
<sup class="v">21:8</sup>But the other disciples came with the
boat, drawing the net of fishes, for they were not far from the
land, but about two hundred cubits distant. <sup class=
"v">21:9</sup>Then when they came to land they saw coals placed,
and a fish laid upon [them], and bread. <sup class=
"v">21:10</sup>Jesus said to them, Bring of the fish that you have
now caught. <sup class="v">21:11</sup>Simon Peter went and drew the
net to the land, full of great fishes a hundred and fifty-three;
and though there were so many the net was not broken. <sup class=
"v">21:12</sup>Jesus said to them, Come and breakfast. No one of
the disciples dared to ask him, Who are you? for they knew that he
was the Lord. <sup class="v">21:13</sup>Jesus came and took the
bread and gave them, and the fish likewise. <sup class=
"v">21:14</sup>This was now the third time that Jesus appeared to
his disciples after he had arisen from the dead.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">21:15</sup>When therefore they
had breakfasted, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of John, do
you love me more than these? He said to him, Yes, Lord, you know
that I am a friend to you. He said to him, Feed my lambs.
<sup class="v">21:16</sup>Again he said to him a second time;
Simon, son of John, do you love me? He said to him, Yes, Lord, you
know that I am a friend to you. He said to him, Feed my sheep.
<sup class="v">21:17</sup>He said to him a third time; Simon, son
of John, are you a friend to me? Peter was grieved that he said to
him the third time, Are you a friend to me? and he said to him,
Lord you know all things; you know that I am a friend to you. Jesus
said to him, Feed my sheep. <sup class="v">21:18</sup>I tell you
most truly, that when you were young you girded yourself and walked
where you would; but when you become old, you shall stretch out
your hands and another shall bind you and carry you where you would
not; <sup class="v">21:19</sup>but he said this signifying by what
death he should glorify God; and having said this, he said to him,
Follow me.</p>
<p class="pin">8 <sup class="v">21:20</sup>And Peter turning
around saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following, who also
reclined at the supper on his breast and said, Lord, who is it that
is to betray you? <sup class="v">21:21</sup>Peter seeing him said
to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man [do]? <sup class=
"v">21:22</sup>Jesus said to him, If I wish him to continue till I
come, what is that to you? follow me. <sup class="v">21:23</sup>The
report then went out among the brothers that this disciple would
not die; but Jesus said not to him, He shall not die; but, If I
wish him to continue till I come, what is that to you?</p>
<p class="pin">9 <sup class="v">21:24</sup>This is the disciple
who testifies of these things and has written them; and we know
that his testimony is true. <sup class="v">21:25</sup>And there are
many other things which Jesus did, which, if they should be written
particularly, I do not suppose the world itself could contain the
books written.</p>
<h1 style="margin-top:6em; margin-bottom:1em"><A name="b44">ACTS OF THE
 APOSTLES.</A></h1>
<hr width="10%">
<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST'S ASCENSION, AND THE ELECTION OF AN APOSTLE IN THE PLACE
OF JUDAS.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">1:1</sup>I WROTE my first
account, O Theophilus, of all things which Jesus did and taught,
<sup class="v">1:2</sup>till the day that having given charge to
the apostles whom he chose by the Holy Spirit he was taken up;
<sup class="v">1:3</sup>to whom also he presented himself living
after his suffering, by many proofs, being seen by them during
forty days, and speaking things relating to the kingdom of God.
<sup class="v">1:4</sup>And assembling them, he charged them not to
depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father,
which [says he] you have heard from me; <sup class=
"v">1:5</sup>that John baptized indeed with water, but you shall be
baptized with the Holy Spirit after a few days.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">1:6</sup>They therefore having
come together asked him, saying, Lord, will you at this time
restore the kingdom of Israel? <sup class="v">1:7</sup>And he said
to them, It is not your [province] to know the times or seasons
which the Father has appointed by his own authority; <sup class=
"v">1:8</sup>but you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has
come upon you, and shall be my witnesses both in Jerusalem, and all
Judea, and Samaria, and to the end of the earth. <sup class=
"v">1:9</sup>And having said these words, as they were looking on
he was taken up, and a cloud received him from their sight.
<sup class="v">1:10</sup>And as they looked steadily to heaven
while he went, behold, two men stood by them in white clothing;
<sup class="v">1:11</sup>and they said, Men of Galilee, why do you
stand looking at heaven? This Jesus taken up from you to heaven
shall so come in the manner in which you have seen him go to
heaven.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">1:12</sup>Then they returned to
Jerusalem from the mountain called [the Mount] of Olives, which is
near Jerusalem, a sabbath day's journey [distant]. <sup class=
"v">1:13</sup>And when they came, they went up into the upper room
where staid Peter and John, and James and Andrew, Philip and
Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alpheus and Simon
the Zealot, and Judas the [brother] of James. <sup class=
"v">1:14</sup>All these continued with one accord in prayer, with
the women, and with Mary the mother of Jesus, and his brothers.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">1:15</sup>And in those days Peter
standing up in the midst of the brothers, said&mdash;the multitude
together was about a hundred and twenty&mdash; <sup class=
"v">1:16</sup>Men and brothers, it was necessary that the Scripture
should be fulfilled which the Holy Spirit spoke before by the mouth
of David, concerning Judas who became a guide to them that
apprehended Jesus; <sup class="v">1:17</sup>For he was numbered
with us, and obtained the inheritance of this service. <sup class=
"v">1:18</sup>This man therefore purchased a field with the price
of the wickedness, and falling headlong burst in the middle and all
his bowels were poured out; <sup class="v">1:19</sup>and this
became known to all who lived at Jerusalem, so that that field was
called in their language Aceldamach, which is Field of blood.
<sup class="v">1:20</sup>For it is written in the book of Psalms,
Let his dwelling be desolate and let no one dwell in it, and his
superintendency let another take. <sup class="v">1:21</sup>It is
necessary therefore that one of the men who have gone with us all
the time in which the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,
<sup class="v">1:22</sup>beginning from the baptism of John till
the day on which he was taken up from us, should be made with us a
witness of his resurrection.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">1:23</sup>And they proposed two;
Joseph called Barsabbas, who was also called Justus, and Matthias.
<sup class="v">1:24</sup>And praying, they said, Do thou, Lord, the
searcher of all hearts, show which of these two thou hast chosen
<sup class="v">1:25</sup>to take the place of this service and
apostleship from which Judas fell by transgression to go to his
place. <sup class="v">1:26</sup>And they cast their lots, and the
lot fell to Matthias, and he was numbered with the eleven
apostles.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<h3>THE DAY OF PENTECOST AND ITS BLESSINGS.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">2:1</sup>AND when the day of
Pentecost had come, they were all with one mind together.
<sup class="v">2:2</sup>And suddenly there came from heaven a sound
as of a violent wind borne along, and it filled all the house where
they were sitting; <sup class="v">2:3</sup>and there appeared to
them divided tongues as of fire, and [one] sat on each one of them;
<sup class="v">2:4</sup>and they were all filled with the Holy
Spirit, and began to speak with tongues as the Spirit gave them
utterance.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">2:5</sup>And there were Jews
living at Jerusalem, pious men, of every nation under heaven;
<sup class="v">2:6</sup>and when this sound was [heard], the
multitude came together and were astonished, for they each one
heard them speaking in his own language. <sup class=
"v">2:7</sup>And they were astonished and wondered, saying, Are not
all these that speak Galileans? <sup class="v">2:8</sup>And how do
we hear each one in our own language in which we were born,
<sup class="v">2:9</sup>Parthians and Medes and Elamites, and those
who live in Mesopotamia, Judea, and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,
<sup class="v">2:10</sup>Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts
of Lybia about Cyrene, and the Roman strangers, both Jews and
proselytes, <sup class="v">2:11</sup>Cretes and Arabs, do we hear
them speak in our tongues of the great works of God. <sup class=
"v">2:12</sup>And they were all astonished and perplexed, saying
one to another, What does this mean? <sup class="v">2:13</sup>But
others mocking said, They are full of sweet wine.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">2:14</sup>But Peter standing up
with the eleven lifted up his voice and said to them, Men of Judea,
and all who live at Jerusalem, be this known to you, and attend to
my words. <sup class="v">2:15</sup>For these are not drunk as you
suppose, for it is the third hour of the day [9 A.M.], <sup class=
"v">2:16</sup>but this is what was said by the prophet; <sup class=
"v">2:17</sup>In the last days, says God, I will pour out of my
Spirit on all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall
prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men
shall dream dreams; <sup class="v">2:18</sup>and upon my male
servants and upon my female servants in those days will I pour out
of my Spirit, and they shall prophesy. <sup class="v">2:19</sup>And
I will show prodigies in heaven above and signs on the earth below,
blood and fire and a cloud of smoke. <sup class="v">2:20</sup>The
sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood, before
the great and illustrious day of the Lord comes. <sup class=
"v">2:21</sup>And whoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall
be saved.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">2:22</sup>Men of Israel, hear
these words; Jesus the Nazoraean, a man approved by God to you by
mighty works and prodigies and miracles, which God performed by him
in the midst of you, as you yourselves know, <sup class=
"v">2:23</sup>this man, delivered up by the determinate counsel and
foreknowledge of God, you have affixed to the cross, and killed by
the hand of the wicked, <sup class="v">2:24</sup>him has God raised
up, having loosed the pains of death, as it was not possible that
he should be held by it. <sup class="v">2:25</sup>For David says of
him, I saw the Lord always before me, he is on my right hand that I
should not be moved; <sup class="v">2:26</sup>therefore my heart
rejoiced and my tongue was glad, and my flesh, moreover, shall also
live in hope; <sup class="v">2:27</sup>for thou wilt not leave my
soul in hades, nor suffer thy Holy One to see destruction.
<sup class="v">2:28</sup>Thou hast made me know the ways of life,
thou wilt fill me with joy with thy presence.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">2:29</sup>Men and brothers, let
me speak to you freely of the patriarch David, that he both died
and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day. <sup class=
"v">2:30</sup>Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that God swore
with an oath to him to set a descendant of his on his throne,
<sup class="v">2:31</sup>foreseeing he spoke of the resurrection of
Christ, that he was not left in hades neither did his flesh see
destruction. <sup class="v">2:32</sup>This Jesus has God raised up,
whose witnesses we all are. <sup class="v">2:33</sup>Being
therefore exalted on the right hand of God, and receiving the
promise of the Holy Spirit from the Father, he has poured this out
which you both see and hear. <sup class="v">2:34</sup>For David
ascended not to heaven, but he says, The Lord said to my lord, Sit
on my right hand <sup class="v">2:35</sup>till I make your enemies
your footstool. <sup class="v">2:36</sup>Let all the house of
Israel therefore know certainly, that God has made this Jesus whom
you crucified both Lord and Christ.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">2:37</sup>And hearing [this] they
were distressed in mind, and said to Peter and the rest of the
apostles, Men and brothers, what shall we do? <sup class=
"v">2:38</sup>And Peter said to them, Change your minds, and be
baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the
forgiveness of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy
Spirit. <sup class="v">2:39</sup>For the promise is to you and your
children, and to all that are afar off, as many as the Lord our God
shall call. <sup class="v">2:40</sup>And with many other words he
testified and exhorted, saying, Save yourselves from this perverse
generation.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">2:41</sup>Then those that
received his word were baptized, and there were added on that day
about three thousand souls; <sup class="v">2:42</sup>and they
attended constantly to the teaching and companionship of the
apostles, the breaking of bread and the prayers. <sup class=
"v">2:43</sup>And fear was on every soul, and many prodigies and
miracles were performed by the apostles. <sup class=
"v">2:44</sup>And all who believed were together and had all things
common; <sup class="v">2:45</sup>and they sold their possessions
and estates, and distributed them to all as any one had need;
<sup class="v">2:46</sup>and continuing day by day with one accord
in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, they partook
of food with gladness and simplicity of mind, <sup class=
"v">2:47</sup>praising God, and having favor with all the people.
And the Lord added the saved, day by day, to the assembly
[church].</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<h3>THE IMPRISONMENT OF PETER AND JOHN.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">3:1</sup>AND Peter and John went
up together to the temple at the hour of prayer, which is the ninth
hour. <sup class="v">3:2</sup>And a certain man lame from his birth
was carried and placed daily at the gate of the temple which is
called Beautiful, to ask charity of those going into the temple;
<sup class="v">3:3</sup>who seeing Peter and John about to enter
into the temple, asked to receive a charity. <sup class=
"v">3:4</sup>But Peter looking steadily at him with John, said,
Look on us. <sup class="v">3:5</sup>And he gave his attention to
them, expecting to receive something from them. <sup class=
"v">3:6</sup>But Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but what
I have, this I give you; in the name of Jesus Christ the Nazoraean,
walk. <sup class="v">3:7</sup>And taking him by the right hand he
raised him up; and immediately his feet and ankles were
strengthened, <sup class="v">3:8</sup>and leaping up he stood and
walked and entered with them into the temple, walking and leaping,
praising God. <sup class="v">3:9</sup>And all the people saw him
walking and praising God; <sup class="v">3:10</sup>and they knew
him, that he was the one who sat for charity at the beautiful gate
of the temple, and they were filled with wonder and astonishment at
what had happened to him.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">3:11</sup>And as he held Peter
and John, all the people ran to them in the porch which is called
Solomon's, greatly wondering. <sup class="v">3:12</sup>And Peter
seeing it answered the people, Men of Israel, why do you wonder at
this? or why do you look intently at us as if by our power or piety
we had made him walk? <sup class="v">3:13</sup>The God of Abraham,
and Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our fathers, glorified his servant
Jesus, whom you delivered up and denied before Pilate when he
decided to release him; <sup class="v">3:14</sup>but you denied the
Holy and Righteous One, and asked a murderer to be given you,
<sup class="v">3:15</sup>but killed the Prince of life, whom God
has raised from the dead, whose witnesses we are. <sup class=
"v">3:16</sup>And by the faith of his name, his name has made
strong this man whom you behold and know, and the faith which is by
him has given him this entire soundness before you all. <sup class=
"v">3:17</sup>And now, brothers, I know that you did it without
knowledge, as did also your rulers; <sup class="v">3:18</sup>but
what God had before declared by the mouth of all the prophets that
his Anointed should suffer, he has so accomplished. <sup class=
"v">3:19</sup>Change your minds, therefore, and turn yourselves,
that your sins may be blotted out, that times of refreshing may
come from the presence of the Lord, <sup class="v">3:20</sup>and he
send to you Jesus Christ before appointed, <sup class=
"v">3:21</sup>whom heaven must receive till the times of the
restoration of all things of which God has spoken by the mouth of
his holy prophets since the world began. <sup class=
"v">3:22</sup>Moses indeed said, A prophet shall the Lord your God
raise up to you, of your brothers, like me; him shall you hear in
all things which he shall speak to you; <sup class=
"v">3:23</sup>and every soul which will not hear that prophet shall
be destroyed from the people. <sup class="v">3:24</sup>And all the
prophets, from Samuel and those following him in order, who have
spoken, have also announced these days. <sup class=
"v">3:25</sup>You are the children of the prophets, and of the
promise which God promised to our fathers, saying to Abraham, And
in your offspring shall all the families of the earth be blessed.
<sup class="v">3:26</sup>God having raised up his servant has sent
him to you first, to bless you by turning each [one of you] from
your evil ways.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">4:1</sup>And while they were
speaking to the people, the priests, and the commander of the
temple, and the Sadducees came upon them, <sup class=
"v">4:2</sup>being displeased because they taught the people and
declared by Jesus the resurrection of the dead; <sup class=
"v">4:3</sup>and they laid hands on them and put them in prison
till the next day; for it was now evening. <sup class=
"v">4:4</sup>But many of those that heard the word believed, and
the number of the men became about five thousand.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">4:5</sup>And on the next day the
rulers, and elders, and scribes <sup class="v">4:6</sup>assembled
at Jerusalem, and Annas the chief priest, and Caiaphas, and John,
and Alexander, and all that were of the family of the chief
priesthood, <sup class="v">4:7</sup>and placing them in the midst,
asked, By what power, or by what name, have you done this?
<sup class="v">4:8</sup>Then Peter, full of the Holy Spirit, said
to them, Rulers of the people and elders of Israel, <sup class=
"v">4:9</sup>if we are to-day examined concerning the good work
done to the sick man, by what means he has been cured, <sup class=
"v">4:10</sup>be it known to you all, and to all the people of
Israel, that in the name of Jesus Christ the Nazoraean, whom you
crucified, whom God raised from the dead, by him has this man stood
before you sound. <sup class="v">4:11</sup>This is the stone
rejected by you builders, which has become the head of a corner.
<sup class="v">4:12</sup>And there is salvation in no other; for
there is no other name given under heaven among men, by which we
can be saved.</p>
<p class="pin"></p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">4:13</sup>And seeing the boldness
of Peter and John, and supposing that they were illiterate and
common men, they wondered, and perceived that they had been with
Jesus; <sup class="v">4:14</sup>and seeing the man standing with
them cured, they could not dispute it. <sup class="v">4:15</sup>And
commanding them to withdraw from the Sanhedrim, they conferred one
with another, <sup class="v">4:16</sup>saying, What shall we do to
these men? for that a notable miracle has been performed by them is
manifest to all that live at Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it;
<sup class="v">4:17</sup>but that it spread no further among the
people, let us threaten them severely, [and charge them] to speak
no more to any man in this name. <sup class="v">4:18</sup>And
calling them, they charged them not to speak or teach at all in the
name of Jesus. <sup class="v">4:19</sup>But Peter and John answered
and said to them, Whether it is right in the sight of God to obey
you rather than God, judge; <sup class="v">4:20</sup>for we cannot
but tell what we have seen and heard. <sup class="v">4:21</sup>And
threatening them still further, they dismissed them, not being able
to punish them, on account of the people, because all glorified God
for what was done; <sup class="v">4:22</sup>for the man was more
than forty years old on whom this miracle of the cure was
performed.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">4:23</sup>And being dismissed
they came to their friends, and related to them what the chief
priests and elders said to them. <sup class="v">4:24</sup>And when
they heard it they lifted up their voice with one consent to God,
and said, Master, thou who hast made heaven, and the earth, the
sea, and all things in them, <sup class="v">4:25</sup>who by the
mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the nations rage and
the peoples devise vain things? <sup class="v">4:26</sup>the kings
of the earth stood up, and the rulers were assembled together
against the Lord, and against his anointed. <sup class=
"v">4:27</sup>For of a truth, in this city, both Herod and Pontius
Pilate, with the gentiles and people of Israel, were assembled
together against thy holy servant Jesus whom thou hast anointed,
<sup class="v">4:28</sup>to do what thy hand and counsel before
appointed to be done. <sup class="v">4:29</sup>And now, Lord, look
down upon their threatenings, and grant to thy servants with all
boldness to speak thy word, <sup class="v">4:30</sup>by stretching
out thy hand, that cures and miracles and prodigies may be
performed by the name of thy holy servant Jesus. <sup class=
"v">4:31</sup>And when they had prayed the place was shaken in
which they were assembled, and they were all filled with the Holy
Spirit, and spoke the word of God with boldness.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<h3>THE LIBERALITY OF THE FIRST CHRISTIANS, ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA,
FURTHER PERSECUTION.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">4:32</sup>AND the multitude that
believed had one heart and one soul, and none said that anything of
his possessions was his; but they had all things common.
<sup class="v">4:33</sup>And the apostles delivered the testimony
of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus with great power, and great
favor was towards them all. <sup class="v">4:34</sup>For no one
among them was needy; for those who possessed lands or houses sold
and brought the prices of the things sold, <sup class=
"v">4:35</sup>and laid them at the apostles' feet; and distribution
was made to each as any one had need. <sup class="v">4:36</sup>And
Joseph, called Barnabas by the apostles, which is interpreted, A
son of consolation, a Levite, a Cyprian by birth, <sup class=
"v">4:37</sup>having land, sold it, and brought the money and laid
it at the feet of the apostles.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">5:1</sup>And one Ananias by name,
with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession, <sup class=
"v">5:2</sup>and he kept back a part of the price, his wife also
being privy to it, and bringing a certain part laid it at the
apostles' feet. <sup class="v">5:3</sup>But Peter said, Ananias,
why has Satan filled your heart that you should lie to the Holy
Spirit, and that you should keep back a part of the price of the
land? <sup class="v">5:4</sup>Continuing unsold was it not yours,
and when it was sold was it not at your disposal? Why did you
propose this thing in your heart? You have not lied to men but to
God. <sup class="v">5:5</sup>And Ananias hearing these words fell
down and expired; and great fear was upon all who heard.
<sup class="v">5:6</sup>And the young men arose and laid him out,
and having carried him out buried him.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">5:7</sup>And after an interval of
about three hours, his wife, not knowing what had happened, came
in. <sup class="v">5:8</sup>And Peter answered her, Tell me whether
you sold the field for so much? And she said, Yes; for so much.
<sup class="v">5:9</sup>And Peter said to her, Why have you agreed
together to try the Spirit of the Lord? Behold, the feet of those
that buried your husband are at the door, and they shall carry you
out. <sup class="v">5:10</sup>And she fell down immediately at his
feet, and expired; and the young men coming in found her dead, and
carried her out, and buried her by her husband. <sup class=
"v">5:11</sup>And great fear was on all the assembly [church], and
on all that heard of these things.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">5:12</sup>And many miracles and
prodigies were performed among the people by the hands of the
apostles; and they were all of one accord in Solomon's porch;
<sup class="v">5:13</sup>and no one of the rest dared to join them,
but the people magnified them; <sup class="v">5:14</sup>and
believers were added the more to the Lord, multitudes both of men
and women; <sup class="v">5:15</sup>so that they brought the sick
into the streets and placed them on little beds and couches, that
as Peter passed along even his shadow might overshadow some of
them. <sup class="v">5:16</sup>And the multitude came together from
the cities about Jerusalem, bringing the sick and those troubled by
impure spirits, all of whom were cured.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">5:17</sup>And the chief priest
arose, and all those with him, being the sect of the Sadducees, and
were filled with wrath, <sup class="v">5:18</sup>and laid hands on
the apostles, and put them in the public prison. <sup class=
"v">5:19</sup>But an angel of the Lord opening the prison doors by
night led them out and said, <sup class="v">5:20</sup>Go, stand and
speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life.
<sup class="v">5:21</sup>And hearing this they entered into the
temple early in the morning and taught. And the chief priest
coming, and those with him, called the Sanhedrim together, and all
the eldership of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to
have them brought.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">5:22</sup>But the officers going
did not find them in the prison; and returning they reported,
<sup class="v">5:23</sup>saying, The prison found we shut with all
safety, and the guards standing before the doors, but opening we
found no one within. <sup class="v">5:24</sup>And when they heard
these words, both the priest and the commander of the temple and
the chief priests doubted concerning them, what this could mean.
<sup class="v">5:25</sup>But some one came and told them, Behold,
the men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple, and
teaching the people.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">5:26</sup>Then the commander
going away with the officers brought them without violence, for
they feared the people, lest they should be stoned; <sup class=
"v">5:27</sup>and having brought them they placed them before the
Sanhedrim. And the chief priest asked them, <sup class=
"v">5:28</sup>saying, We charged you strictly not to teach in this
name, and behold, you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and
wish to bring this man's blood on us. <sup class="v">5:29</sup>And
Peter answering, and the apostles, said, It is necessary to obey
God rather than man. <sup class="v">5:30</sup>The God of our
fathers raised up Jesus, whom you took and hung on a cross;
<sup class="v">5:31</sup>him has God exalted, a Prince and Saviour
at his right hand, to give a change of mind to Israel and the
forgiveness of sins. <sup class="v">5:32</sup>And we are his
witnesses of these things, and also the Holy Spirit which God has
given to those that obey him.</p>
<p class="pin">8 <sup class="v">5:33</sup>And when they heard
this they were highly offended, and took counsel to kill them.
<sup class="v">5:34</sup>But a certain Pharisee in the Sanhedrim,
by the name of Gamaliel, a teacher of the law, in honor with all
the people, standing up requested them to put the men out a little
while; <sup class="v">5:35</sup>and he said to them, Men of Israel,
take heed to yourselves what you are about to do to these men.
<sup class="v">5:36</sup>For before these days Theudas arose,
saying that he was somebody, to whom a number of men, about four
hundred, adhered, who was destroyed, and all who obeyed him passed
away and came to nothing.</p>
<p class="pin">9 <sup class="v">5:37</sup>After him arose Judas
the Galilean, in the days of the census, and drew away people after
him; and he was destroyed, and all who obeyed him were dispersed.
<sup class="v">5:38</sup>And now I tell you, abstain from these
men, and let them alone; because if this design, or this work, is
from men, it will be destroyed; <sup class="v">5:39</sup>but if it
is from God, you cannot destroy them; lest you be found at some
time to be fighting against God. <sup class="v">5:40</sup>And they
were persuaded by him, and calling the apostles and scourging them,
they charged them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and dismissed
them. <sup class="v">5:41</sup>They went therefore from the
presence of the Sanhedrim, rejoicing that they were accounted
worthy to suffer shame for the name of [Christ]; <sup class=
"v">5:42</sup>and every day in the temple, and from house to house,
they ceased not teaching and preaching the good news of Christ
Jesus.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>
<h3>THE APPOINTMENT OF SEVEN DEACONS, THE SERMON AND MARTYRDOM OF
STEPHEN, AND A GENERAL PERSECUTION.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">6:1</sup>AND in those days the
disciples being multiplied, there was a complaint of the Hellenists
against the Hebrews, that their widows were neglected in the daily
service. <sup class="v">6:2</sup>And the twelve calling the
multitude of the disciples, said, It is not desirable that we
should leave the word of God to serve tables. <sup class=
"v">6:3</sup>Look out therefore, brothers, from among you seven men
of good repute, full of the Holy Spirit, and of wisdom, whom we may
set over this business; <sup class="v">6:4</sup>but we will attend
continually to prayer, and the ministry of the word.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">6:5</sup>And the proposition
pleased all the multitude, and they elected Stephen, a man full of
faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip and Prochorus, and Nicanor
and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolaus a proselyte of Antioch,
<sup class="v">6:6</sup>and set them before the Apostles; and they
having prayed imposed hands on them. <sup class="v">6:7</sup>And
the word of God increased, and the number of the disciples was
greatly multiplied at Jerusalem, and a great multitude of the
priests obeyed the faith.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">6:8</sup>And Stephen, full of
grace and power, performed prodigies and great miracles among the
people. <sup class="v">6:9</sup>But some members of the synagogue
called that of the Libertines and Cyrenians and Alexandrians and of
those from Cilicia and Asia, arose and disputed with Stephen,
<sup class="v">6:10</sup>and were not able to resist the wisdom and
spirit with which he spoke. <sup class="v">6:11</sup>Then they
bribed men who said, We heard him speak blasphemous words against
Moses and God. <sup class="v">6:12</sup>And they stirred up both
the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and coming suddenly
they seized him and led him to the Sanhedrim, <sup class=
"v">6:13</sup>and brought forward false witnesses who said, This
man speaks incessantly against this holy place, and the law;
<sup class="v">6:14</sup>for we have heard him say, that Jesus this
Nazoraean will destroy this place and change the customs which
Moses gave us. <sup class="v">6:15</sup>And all who sat in the
Sanhedrin looking steadily at him saw his face like the face of an
angel.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">7:1</sup>And the chief priest
said, Are these things then so? <sup class="v">7:2</sup>And he
said, Men, brothers, and fathers, hear. The God of glory appeared
to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived
in Haran, <sup class="v">7:3</sup>and said to him, Go out from your
country and your kindred, and come to a land which I will show you.
<sup class="v">7:4</sup>Then going out from the land of the
Chaldeans, he lived in Haran. And thence, after the death of his
father, he removed into this land in which you now live.
<sup class="v">7:5</sup>And [God] gave him no inheritance in it,
not the breadth of a foot, and promised to give it to him for a
possession, and to his posterity after him, when as yet he had no
son. <sup class="v">7:6</sup>And God said thus; that his posterity
should be a stranger in a foreign land, and they shall enslave it
and treat it injuriously four hundred years; <sup class=
"v">7:7</sup>and the nation which they shall serve will I judge,
said God, and after that they shall come forth and serve me in this
place.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">7:8</sup>And he gave him the
ordinance of circumcision; and so he begat Isaac and circumcised
him on the eighth day, and Isaac, Jacob, and Jacob the twelve
patriarchs. <sup class="v">7:9</sup>And the patriarchs envying
Joseph sold him into Egypt; and God was with him <sup class=
"v">7:10</sup>and delivered him from all his afflictions, and gave
him favor and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and
[he] made him governor over Egypt and all his house.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">7:11</sup>And there came a famine
on all the land of Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction, and our
fathers found no provisions. <sup class="v">7:12</sup>But Jacob
hearing that there was grain in Egypt, sent our fathers the first
time; <sup class="v">7:13</sup>and the second time Joseph was made
known to his brothers, and Joseph's family was made known to
Pharaoh. <sup class="v">7:14</sup>And Joseph sent and called for
his father Jacob, and all the family of seventy-five souls.
<sup class="v">7:15</sup>And Jacob went down to Egypt, and died, he
and our fathers; <sup class="v">7:16</sup>and they carried him back
to Shechem and buried him in the tomb which Abraham bought for
money of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">7:17</sup>But when the time of
the promise which God made with an oath to Abraham was at hand, the
people increased and became numerous in Egypt, <sup class=
"v">7:18</sup>till another king arose who knew not Joseph.
<sup class="v">7:19</sup>This [king] dealt deceitfully with our
race, and treated injuriously our fathers, causing their infants to
be exposed that they might not be preserved alive.</p>
<p class="pin">8 <sup class="v">7:20</sup>At that time Moses was
born, and was beautiful in the sight of God, and was nourished
three months in his father's house; <sup class="v">7:21</sup>but
being exposed, the daughter of Pharaoh took him up and nourished
him as her own son. <sup class="v">7:22</sup>And Moses was educated
in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in his words and
works. <sup class="v">7:23</sup>And when he was forty years old, it
came into his mind to visit his brothers, the children of Israel.
<sup class="v">7:24</sup>And seeing one injured he defended him,
and executed judgment for the oppressed, smiting the Egyptian.
<sup class="v">7:25</sup>And he thought his brothers would
understand that God would give them salvation by his hand; but they
understood not.</p>
<p class="pin">9 <sup class="v">7:26</sup>On the following day
also he showed himself to them as they contended, and urged them to
peace, saying, Men, you are brothers; why do you injure one
another? <sup class="v">7:27</sup>But he that injured his neighbor
repelled him, saying, Who made you a ruler and a judge over us?
<sup class="v">7:28</sup>Will you kill me as you did the Egyptian,
yesterday? <sup class="v">7:29</sup>And Moses fled at that saying,
and lived a stranger in the land of Midian, where he begat two
sons.</p>
<p class="pin">10 <sup class="v">7:30</sup>And forty years being
completed there appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai,
an angel in a flame of fire, in a bush. <sup class=
"v">7:31</sup>And Moses seeing it, wondered at the sight; and
coming near to look at it, there was a voice of the Lord,
<sup class="v">7:32</sup>I am the God of your fathers, the God of
Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob. And Moses being afraid dared not
look at it. <sup class="v">7:33</sup>And the Lord said to him, Put
off your shoes from your feet; for the place on which you stand is
holy ground. <sup class="v">7:34</sup>I have seen the affliction of
my people in Egypt, and have heard their groaning, and have come
down to deliver them; and now come, I will send you to Egypt.</p>
<p class="pin">11 <sup class="v">7:35</sup>This is the Moses whom
they denied, saying, Who made you a ruler and a judge? Him did God
send to be a ruler and a redeemer by the hand of the angel that
appeared to him in the bush. <sup class="v">7:36</sup>This man
brought them out, having performed prodigies and miracles in Egypt,
and at the Red Sea, and in the wilderness forty years. <sup class=
"v">7:37</sup>This is the Moses who said to the children of Israel,
A prophet shall God raise up for you, of your brothers, like me.
<sup class="v">7:38</sup>This is he that was with the assembly in
the wilderness, with the angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai, and
with our fathers, who received the living oracles to give us,
<sup class="v">7:39</sup>whom our fathers would not obey, but
thrust him away and turned back in their hearts to Egypt,
<sup class="v">7:40</sup>saying to Aaron, Make us gods to go before
us; for this Moses who led us up out of Egypt, we know not what has
happened to him.</p>
<p class="pin">12 <sup class="v">7:41</sup>And they made a calf
in those days, and offered a sacrifice to the idol, and rejoiced in
the works of their hands. <sup class="v">7:42</sup>And God turned
and gave them up to serve the host of heaven, as it is written in
the book of the prophets; Did you offer victims and sacrifices to
me forty years in the wilderness, house of Israel, <sup class=
"v">7:43</sup>and take up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of
the god Rephan, figures which you made to worship? I will even
remove you beyond Babylon.</p>
<p class="pin">13 <sup class="v">7:44</sup>Our fathers in the
wilderness received the tabernacle of the testimony, as he that
spoke to Moses charged him to make it according to the pattern
which he had seen; <sup class="v">7:45</sup>which also our fathers
receiving it in succession brought with Joshua into the possession
of the nations, whom God expelled before the face of our fathers
till the days of David; <sup class="v">7:46</sup>who found favor
with God and desired to find a dwelling for the God of Jacob.
<sup class="v">7:47</sup>And Solomon built him a house. <sup class=
"v">7:48</sup>But the Most High dwells not in [temples] made with
hands, as the prophet says; <sup class="v">7:49</sup>Heaven is my
throne, and the earth my footstool; what house will you build me,
says the Lord, or what is the place of my rest? <sup class=
"v">7:50</sup>has not my hand made all these things? <sup class=
"v">7:51</sup>Stiff necked, and uncircumcised in heart and ears,
you always fight against the Holy Spirit; as your fathers did, you
also do. <sup class="v">7:52</sup>Which of the prophets did not
your fathers persecute? And they killed those who foretold the
coming of the Righteous One, of whom you now have become betrayers
and murderers, <sup class="v">7:53</sup>who have received the law
by orders of angels and have not kept it.</p>
<p class="pin">14 <sup class="v">7:54</sup>And when they heard
these things they were enraged in their minds and gnashed their
teeth upon him. <sup class="v">7:55</sup>But he being full of the
Holy Spirit, looking steadily to heaven saw the glory of God and
Jesus standing on the right hand of God, <sup class=
"v">7:56</sup>and said, Behold, I see the heavens opened and the
Son of man standing on the right hand of God. <sup class=
"v">7:57</sup>And crying with a loud voice they stopped their ears
and rushed upon him with one accord, <sup class="v">7:58</sup>and
casting him out of the city, stoned him. And the witnesses laid
down their clothes at the feet of a young man called Saul,
<sup class="v">7:59</sup>and they stoned Stephen, calling and
saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit. <sup class="v">7:60</sup>And
kneeling down he cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to
their charge. And having said this he fell asleep. <sup class=
"v">8:1</sup>And Saul consented to his death.</p>
<p class="pin">15 And at that time there was a great persecution
of the church at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad
through the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles.
<sup class="v">8:2</sup>And pious men buried Stephen and made a
great lamentation for him. <sup class="v">8:3</sup>But Saul
persecuted the church, and going from house to house, seizing men
and women, committed them to prison.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<h3>THE EARLY MINISTRY OF PHILIP THE DEACON, THE CONVERSION OF THE
SAMARITANS, THE ETHIOPIAN EUNUCH.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">8:4</sup>Being scattered abroad,
therefore, they went everywhere preaching the good news of the
word; <sup class="v">8:5</sup>and Philip going down to a city of
Samaria preached Christ to them. <sup class="v">8:6</sup>And the
multitudes attended with one accord to the things said by Philip,
when they heard him and saw the miracles which he performed.
<sup class="v">8:7</sup>For impure spirits came out of many who had
them, crying with a loud voice; and many paralytics and lame
persons were cured; <sup class="v">8:8</sup>and there was great joy
in that city.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">8:9</sup>And there was a man by
the name of Simon who formerly practised magic in that city, and
astonished the nation of Samaria, saying that he was some great
person, <sup class="v">8:10</sup>to whom all from the least to the
greatest attended, saying, This is the power of God which is called
great. <sup class="v">8:11</sup>And they attended to him because
for a long time he had astonished them with his magic arts.
<sup class="v">8:12</sup>But because they believed Philip preaching
the good news of the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ,
they were baptized both men and women. <sup class="v">8:13</sup>And
Simon also himself believed, and being baptized attended constantly
on Philip; and beholding the mighty works and miracles that were
performed, he was astonished.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">8:14</sup>And the apostles at
Jerusalem hearing that Samaria had received the word of God, sent
to them Peter and John, <sup class="v">8:15</sup>who came down and
prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit;
<sup class="v">8:16</sup>for it had not yet fallen on any of them,
only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. <sup class=
"v">8:17</sup>Then they laid hands on them and they received the
Holy Spirit. <sup class="v">8:18</sup>And Simon seeing that the
Holy Spirit was given by the imposition of the hands of the
apostles, offered them money, <sup class="v">8:19</sup>saying, Give
me this power, that on whomsoever I lay my hand he may receive the
Holy Spirit. <sup class="v">8:20</sup>But Peter said to him, Your
money go to perdition with you; because you have thought to
purchase the gift of God with money. <sup class="v">8:21</sup>You
have no part nor inheritance in this work; for your heart is not
right before God. <sup class="v">8:22</sup>Turn your mind therefore
from this your wickedness, and pray the Lord if perhaps the thought
of your mind may be forgiven you; <sup class="v">8:23</sup>for I
see you are in the gall of bitterness and bond of wickedness.
<sup class="v">8:24</sup>And Simon answered and said, Pray to the
Lord for me, that none of the things which you have said may come
upon me.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">8:25</sup>They then having fully
testified and spoken the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem,
and preached the good news to many villages of the Samaritans.
<sup class="v">8:26</sup>And an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip,
saying, Arise and go to the south, by the way that leads from
Jerusalem to Gaza; this is a wilderness. <sup class=
"v">8:27</sup>And he arose and went. And behold a man, an Ethiopian
eunuch, an officer of Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who was over
all her treasures, who had come to Jerusalem to worship,
<sup class="v">8:28</sup>and he was returning and sitting in his
chariot reading the prophet Isaiah.</p>
<p class="pin"></p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">8:29</sup>And the Spirit said to
Philip, Go forward and join yourself to his chariot. <sup class=
"v">8:30</sup>And Philip running forward heard him reading the
prophet Isaiah, and he said, Do you really understand what you
read? <sup class="v">8:31</sup>And he said [No]; for how can I
unless some one teaches me? And he invited Philip to come up and
sit with him. <sup class="v">8:32</sup>And the passage of Scripture
which he was reading, was this; As a sheep is led to slaughter, and
as a lamb before one that shears him is dumb, so he opened not his
mouth. <sup class="v">8:33</sup>In his humiliation his judgment was
taken away; and who will tell of his generation? for his life was
taken from the earth.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">8:34</sup>And the eunuch answered
and said to Philip, Of whom I pray you does the prophet say this?
of himself or of some other one? <sup class="v">8:35</sup>And
Philip opening his mouth, and beginning from this Scripture,
preached to him the good news of Jesus. <sup class=
"v">8:36</sup>And as they went on the way they came to a certain
water, and the eunuch said, Behold water; what hinders me from
being baptized? <sup class="v">8:38</sup>And he commanded the
chariot to stop, and they both went down to the water, both Philip
and the eunuch, and he baptized him. <sup class="v">8:39</sup>And
when they went up from the water the Spirit of the Lord caught away
Philip, and the eunuch saw him no more; for he went his way
rejoicing. <sup class="v">8:40</sup>But Philip was found at Azotus,
and passing through he preached the good news to all the cities
till he came to C&aelig;sarea.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<h3>THE CONVERSION OF SAUL, PETER CURING &AElig;NEAS, AND RAISING
DORCAS FROM THE DEAD.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">9:1</sup>BUT Saul, yet breathing
out threatening and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord,
went to the chief priest <sup class="v">9:2</sup>and asked of him
letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of that
way, he might bring them bound, men and women, to Jerusalem.
<sup class="v">9:3</sup>And he was going and had come nigh to
Damascus, and suddenly a light shone around him from heaven,
<sup class="v">9:4</sup>and falling on the earth he heard a voice
saying to him, Saul, Saul, Why do you persecute me? <sup class=
"v">9:5</sup>And he said, Who are you, Lord? And he said, I am
Jesus whom you persecute. <sup class="v">9:6</sup>But arise and
enter into the city, and it shall be told you what you must do.
<sup class="v">9:7</sup>And the men travelling with him stood
amazed, hearing indeed the voice, but beholding no one. <sup class=
"v">9:8</sup>And Saul arose from the earth, and his eyes being
opened he saw nothing; and leading him by the hand they conducted
him to Damascus. <sup class="v">9:9</sup>And he was three days
without sight, and neither eat nor drank.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">9:10</sup>And there was a certain
disciple at Damascus by the name of Ananias, and the Lord said to
him in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, I am here, Lord.
<sup class="v">9:11</sup>And the Lord said to him, Arise and go to
the street called Straight, and inquire at the house of Judas for
[a man] by the name of Saul of Tarsus; for behold, he prays,
<sup class="v">9:12</sup>and has seen a man by the name of Ananias
coming and putting a hand on him, that he might receive his sight.
<sup class="v">9:13</sup>And Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard
by many of this man, how much evil he has done to your saints at
Jerusalem; <sup class="v">9:14</sup>and here he has power from the
chief priests to bind all that call on your name. <sup class=
"v">9:15</sup>But the Lord said to him, Go, for he is a chosen
vessel to me, to bear my name both before nations and kings, and
the children of Israel; <sup class="v">9:16</sup>for I will show
him how great things he must suffer for my name.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">9:17</sup>And Ananias went and
entered into the house, and laying hands on him said, Brother Saul,
the Lord has sent me, Jesus who appeared to you on the way which
you came, that you may receive sight and be filled with the Holy
Spirit. <sup class="v">9:18</sup>And immediately there fell from
his eyes as it were scales, and he received his sight, and rising
up was baptized, <sup class="v">9:19</sup>and having received food
was strengthened.</p>
<p class="pin">4 And he was with the disciples at Damascus some
days; <sup class="v">9:20</sup>and immediately in the synagogues he
preached Jesus, that this is the Son of God. <sup class=
"v">9:21</sup>And all that heard him were astonished and said, Is
not this he that destroyed those who called on this name at
Jerusalem, and has come here for this purpose, that he might lead
them bound to the chief priests? <sup class="v">9:22</sup>But Saul
increased in power and confounded the Jews living at Damascus,
proving that this is the Christ.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">9:23</sup>And when some days had
passed, the Jews took counsel to kill him; <sup class=
"v">9:24</sup>and their design was made known to Saul. And they
watched the gates day and night to kill him; <sup class=
"v">9:25</sup>but the disciples took him by night and sent him away
by the wall, letting him down in a store-basket.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">9:26</sup>And going to Jerusalem
he endeavored to join the disciples; and they all feared him, not
believing that he was a disciple. <sup class="v">9:27</sup>But
Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles, and related to
them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to
him, and how he had spoken boldly in Damascus in the name of Jesus.
<sup class="v">9:28</sup>And he was with them, entering in and
going out at Jerusalem, <sup class="v">9:29</sup>and speaking
boldly in the name of the Lord; and he spoke and disputed with the
Hellenists; and they undertook to kill him; <sup class=
"v">9:30</sup>but the brothers knowing it led him away to
C&aelig;sarea and sent him to Tarsus.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">9:31</sup>Then had the church
peace in all Judea and Galilee and Samaria, and being built up, and
walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy
Spirit, they were multiplied. <sup class="v">9:32</sup>And Peter
passing through all places, went down also to the saints living at
Lydda. <sup class="v">9:33</sup>And he found there a certain man by
the name of &AElig;neas, who had lain on a bed for eight years, and
was a paralytic. <sup class="v">9:34</sup>And Peter said to him,
&AElig;neas, Jesus Christ cures you; arise and make your bed for
yourself. And he immediately arose; <sup class="v">9:35</sup>and
all those who lived at Lydda and Sharon saw him, and turned to the
Lord.</p>
<p class="pin">8 <sup class="v">9:36</sup>And there was at Joppa
a certain female disciple called Tabitha, which being interpreted
is called, Dorcas; she was full of good works and charities which
she bestowed. <sup class="v">9:37</sup>And in those days she was
sick and died; and having washed they put her in an upper room.
<sup class="v">9:38</sup>But Lydda being nigh to Joppa, the
disciples hearing that Peter was there sent two men to him
requesting, Do not delay to come to us. <sup class=
"v">9:39</sup>And Peter arose and came with them; and when he had
come they led him into the upper room, and all the widows stood by
weeping and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas made while
she was with them. <sup class="v">9:40</sup>And Peter putting them
all out knelt down and prayed, and turning to the body he said,
Tabitha, arise! And she opened her eyes, and seeing Peter sat up.
<sup class="v">9:41</sup>And giving her his hand he raised her up,
and calling the saints and widows presented her living. <sup class=
"v">9:42</sup>And this was known in all Joppa, and many believed on
the Lord. <sup class="v">9:43</sup>And Peter continued many days at
Joppa with one Simon a tanner.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<h3>THE CONVERSION OF CORNELIUS, AND OTHER GENTILES.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">10:1</sup>AND a certain man at
C&aelig;sarea, named Cornelius, a centurion of the cohort which was
called the Italian, <sup class="v">10:2</sup>a pious man, and one
fearing God with all his house, and bestowing many charities on the
people, and praying to God always, <sup class="v">10:3</sup>saw
clearly in a vision, about the ninth hour of the day, an angel of
God coming to him, and saying to him, Cornelius. <sup class=
"v">10:4</sup>And looking steadily at him and being afraid, he
said, What is wanted, Lord? And he said to him, Your prayers and
charities have come up as a memorial before God. <sup class=
"v">10:5</sup>And now send men to Joppa and call for a certain
Simon who is called Peter; <sup class="v">10:6</sup>he lodges with
one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea. <sup class=
"v">10:7</sup>And when the angel who spoke to him had departed, he
called two of the house servants, and a pious soldier of those that
attended constantly on him, <sup class="v">10:8</sup>and having
related all things to them sent them to Joppa.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">10:9</sup>And on the next day, as
they were pursuing their journey and had come nigh to the city,
Peter went upon the house to pray, about the sixth hour.
<sup class="v">10:10</sup>And he was hungry and wished to eat; and
while they were preparing a trance came upon him, <sup class=
"v">10:11</sup>and he beheld heaven opened, and a certain vessel
like a great sheet descending, let down by four corners to the
earth, <sup class="v">10:12</sup>in which were all the quadrupeds
and reptiles of the earth, and birds of heaven. <sup class=
"v">10:13</sup>And a voice came to him, Arise, Peter, kill and eat.
<sup class="v">10:14</sup>But Peter said, By no means, Lord, for I
have never eaten any thing common and impure. <sup class=
"v">10:15</sup>And a voice came to him again, a second time, What
God has purified, regard not common. <sup class="v">10:16</sup>And
this was done thrice, and immediately the vessel was taken up to
heaven.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">10:17</sup>And while Peter
doubted with himself what the vision which he had seen meant,
behold, even [then] the men sent by Cornelius, having inquired for
the house of Simon, stood at the gate, <sup class=
"v">10:18</sup>and calling aloud asked if Simon who was called
Peter lodged there. <sup class="v">10:19</sup>And while Peter was
considering of the vision, the Spirit said to him, Behold, men seek
you; <sup class="v">10:20</sup>arise and go down and go with them
without hesitation, for I have sent them. <sup class=
"v">10:21</sup>And Peter went down to the men and said, Behold, I
am the man whom you seek; what is the cause for which you have
come? <sup class="v">10:22</sup>And they said, Cornelius a
centurion, a righteous man, and one that fears God, and esteemed by
all the nation of the Jews, was divinely instructed by a holy angel
to send for you to his house and hear words from you. <sup class=
"v">10:23</sup>Then he called them in and entertained them.</p>
<p class="pin">4 And the next day he arose and went with them,
and some of the brothers from Joppa went with him. <sup class=
"v">10:24</sup>And on the day following they came to C&aelig;sarea;
and Cornelius was expecting them, and had called together his
relations and particular friends. <sup class="v">10:25</sup>And
when Peter came in Cornelius met him, and falling down at his feet
worshipped him. <sup class="v">10:26</sup>But Peter raised him up
saying, Arise, I also am a man. <sup class="v">10:27</sup>And
conversing with him he went in, and found many come together;
<sup class="v">10:28</sup>and he said to them, You know that it is
not lawful for a Jew to associate with a man of another nation, or
come into his house; and God has taught me not to call any man
common or impure; <sup class="v">10:29</sup>wherefore, being sent
for I also came without objecting. I ask therefore for what reason
you have sent for me? <sup class="v">10:30</sup>And Cornelius said,
From the fourth hour of the day I fasted till this hour, and at the
ninth hour I was praying in my house, and behold, a man stood
before me in splendid clothing, <sup class="v">10:31</sup>and said,
Cornelius, your prayer is heard and your charities are remembered
before God. <sup class="v">10:32</sup>Send therefore to Joppa and
call Simon who is called Peter; he lodges at the house of Simon a
tanner, by the sea, who when he has come will speak to you.
<sup class="v">10:33</sup>Immediately therefore I sent to you, and
you have done well to come. Now therefore we are all present before
God to hear all things which God has commanded you.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">10:34</sup>And Peter opening his
mouth said, Of a truth I perceive that God is not a respecter of
persons, <sup class="v">10:35</sup>but in every nation he that
fears him and does righteousness is acceptable to him. <sup class=
"v">10:36</sup>The word which he sent to the children of Israel,
preaching the good news of peace by Jesus Christ,&mdash;he is Lord
of all,&mdash; <sup class="v">10:37</sup>you know; the word which
was [preached] through all Judea, beginning in Galilee after the
baptism which John preached, <sup class="v">10:38</sup>Jesus from
Nazareth, how God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and power, who
went about doing good and curing all that were subjugated by the
devil, for God was with him; <sup class="v">10:39</sup>and we are
witnesses of all things which he did, both in the land of Judea,
and at Jerusalem, whom also they killed, hanging him on a cross.
<sup class="v">10:40</sup>This [man] did God raise up on the third
day, and permitted him to be made manifest, <sup class=
"v">10:41</sup>not to all the people, but to witnesses chosen
before by God, to us, who eat and drank with him after he rose from
the dead; <sup class="v">10:42</sup>and he commanded us to preach
to the people and testify fully that he is appointed by God the
judge of living and dead. <sup class="v">10:43</sup>To him all the
prophets bear witness, that every one who believes in him has
forgiveness of sins through his name.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">10:44</sup>While Peter was yet
speaking these words the Holy Spirit fell on all who heard the
word. <sup class="v">10:45</sup>And those of the circumcision who
came with Peter were astonished, that on the gentiles also the gift
of the Holy Spirit was poured out; <sup class="v">10:46</sup>for
they heard them speaking with tongues and magnifying God. Then
Peter answered, <sup class="v">10:47</sup>Can any forbid water that
these should be baptized, who have received the Holy Spirit as we
also have? <sup class="v">10:48</sup>And he commanded that they
should be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then they desired him
to remain some days.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<h3>PETER CALLED TO ACCOUNT FOR ASSOCIATING WITH GENTILES, AND
JUSTIFIED; PREACHING TO THE GENTILES CONTINUED.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">11:1</sup>AND the apostles and
brothers who were in Judea heard that the gentiles received the
word of God. <sup class="v">11:2</sup>And when Peter went up to
Jerusalem, those of the circumcision contended with him,
<sup class="v">11:3</sup>saying, You went in to men that were
uncircumcised, and eat with them. <sup class="v">11:4</sup>And
Peter began and related to them in order, saying, <sup class=
"v">11:5</sup>I was in the city of Joppa praying, and I saw a
vision in a trance, a vessel like a great sheet descending, let
down by the four corners from heaven, and it came to me;
<sup class="v">11:6</sup>and looking into it attentively I
perceived and saw the quadrupeds of the earth and wild beasts and
reptiles and birds of heaven. <sup class="v">11:7</sup>And I heard
a voice saying to me, Arise, Peter, kill and eat. <sup class=
"v">11:8</sup>And I said, By no means, Lord, for nothing common or
impure has ever entered into my mouth. <sup class="v">11:9</sup>And
a voice answered from heaven a second time, What God has purified
do not you regard common. <sup class="v">11:10</sup>And this was
done thrice, and again all were taken up to heaven.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">11:11</sup>And behold,
immediately three men came to the house in which I was, being sent
for me from C&aelig;sarea. <sup class="v">11:12</sup>And the Spirit
told me to go with them. And these six brothers also went with me,
and we entered into the house of the man. <sup class=
"v">11:13</sup>And he told us how he had seen the angel in his
house standing and saying to him, Send to Joppa and call Simon who
is called Peter, <sup class="v">11:14</sup>who will speak words to
you by which you shall be saved and all your house. <sup class=
"v">11:15</sup>And when I began to speak the Holy Spirit fell on
them as also on us in the beginning. <sup class="v">11:16</sup>And
I remembered the word of the Lord how he said, John indeed baptized
with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit.
<sup class="v">11:17</sup>If therefore God gave the gift equally to
them and to us, who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I
that I should be able to forbid God? <sup class="v">11:18</sup>And
hearing these things they were silent, and glorified God, saying,
Then to the gentiles also has God indeed given the change of mind
to life.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">11:19</sup>And those scattered
abroad by the affliction which commenced with Stephen, went even to
Phenicia, and Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to no one but
Jews only. <sup class="v">11:20</sup>But some of them, Cyprians and
Cyrenians, who came to Antioch, spoke to the Greeks preaching the
good news of the Lord Jesus. <sup class="v">11:21</sup>And the hand
of the Lord was with them, and a great number believed and turned
to the Lord. <sup class="v">11:22</sup>And a report concerning them
was brought to the ears of the church at Jerusalem, and they sent
Barnabas to go as far as Antioch; <sup class="v">11:23</sup>who
having come and seen the grace of God rejoiced, and exhorted all to
adhere to the Lord with the purpose of the heart; <sup class=
"v">11:24</sup>for he was a good man and full of the Holy Spirit
and of faith. And a great multitude were added to the Lord.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">11:25</sup>And he went to Tarsus
to seek for Saul, <sup class="v">11:26</sup>and found and brought
him to Antioch. And he was with them, and they met a whole year
with the church and taught a great multitude; and the disciples
first took the name of Christians at Antioch.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">11:27</sup>And in those days
prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch; <sup class=
"v">11:28</sup>and one of them, by the name of Agabus, standing up
signified by the spirit that a great famine was about to come on
all the world; which also came under Claudius C&aelig;sar.
<sup class="v">11:29</sup>And each of the disciples, according to
his ability, determined to send help to the brethren living in
Judea; <sup class="v">11:30</sup>which they also did, sending to
the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>
<h3>PERSECUTION BY HEROD AGRIPPA, HIS DEATH.&mdash;A.D. 44.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">12:1</sup>AND at that time Herod
the king put forth his hands to injure some of the church.
<sup class="v">12:2</sup>And he killed James the brother of John
with the sword. <sup class="v">12:3</sup>And seeing that it pleased
the Jews, he proceeded to apprehend Peter also,&mdash;and it was
during the days of unleavened bread,&mdash; <sup class=
"v">12:4</sup>and having seized he put him in prison, committing
him to four companies of four soldiers each to guard him, wishing
after the passover to bring him before the people. <sup class=
"v">12:5</sup>Peter therefore was kept by the guard; but prayer was
made incessantly by the church to God for him. <sup class=
"v">12:6</sup>And when Herod was about to bring him forward, on
that night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two
chains, and guards kept watch before the door. <sup class=
"v">12:7</sup>And behold, an angel of the Lord came, and a light
shone in the building; and striking Peter on the side he awoke him
saying, Arise quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands.
<sup class="v">12:8</sup>And the angel said to him, Gird yourself,
and tie on your sandals. And he did so. And he said to him, Put
your cloak about you, and follow me. <sup class="v">12:9</sup>And
going out he followed him, and knew not that it was real which was
done by the angel, but thought he saw a vision. <sup class=
"v">12:10</sup>And passing through the first guard, and the second,
they came to the iron gate leading into the city, which opened to
them of itself, and going out they went forward one street, and
immediately the angel left him. <sup class="v">12:11</sup>And Peter
coming to himself said, Now I know that the Lord has really sent
his angel and delivered me from the hand of Herod and all the
expectation of the Jews.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">12:12</sup>And considering within
himself he came to the house of Mary the mother of John called
Mark, where a great number were assembled together and praying.
<sup class="v">12:13</sup>And knocking at the door of the gate, a
female servant, called Rhoda, came to listen, <sup class=
"v">12:14</sup>and knowing the voice of Peter she did not open the
gate from joy, but ran in and told that Peter stood before the
gate. <sup class="v">12:15</sup>But they said to her, You are mad.
But she asserted strongly that it was so. And they said, It is his
angel. <sup class="v">12:16</sup>But Peter continued knocking; and
having opened they saw him, and were astonished. <sup class=
"v">12:17</sup>And making signs to them with his hand to be silent,
he related how the Lord had conducted him out of the prison, and
said, Tell these things to James and the brothers. And going out he
departed to another place.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">12:18</sup>And when it was day
there was no small stir among the soldiers as to what had become of
Peter. <sup class="v">12:19</sup>And Herod seeking and not finding
him, examined the guards, and commanded them to be put to death,
and going down from Judea to C&aelig;sarea remained [there].</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">12:20</sup>And he was displeased
with the Tyrians and Sidonians; but they came with one accord to
him, and having persuaded Blastus who was over the king's
bedchamber, desired peace, because their country was nourished by
the king's. <sup class="v">12:21</sup>And on an appointed day Herod
having put on his royal apparel, and sitting on the tribunal, made
a speech to them; <sup class="v">12:22</sup>and the people shouted,
It is the voice of a god, and not of a man. <sup class=
"v">12:23</sup>And an angel of the Lord instantly smote him because
he gave not glory to God, and being eaten with worms he expired.
<sup class="v">12:24</sup>And the word of God grew and was
increased.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
<h3>THE FIRST MISSION OF PAUL AND BARNABAS TO CYPRUS AND ASIA
MINOR.&mdash;A.D. 46-49.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">12:25</sup>AND Barnabas and Saul
returned from Jerusalem, having performed the service, taking with
them also John who was called Mark. <sup class="v">13:1</sup>And
there were prophets and teachers in the church at Antioch; Barnabas
and Simeon called Niger [the black], and Lucius the Cyrenian, and
Manaen the foster brother of Herod the Tetrarch, and Saul.
<sup class="v">13:2</sup>And while they served the Lord and fasted,
the Holy Spirit said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work to
which I have called them. <sup class="v">13:3</sup>Then having
fasted and prayed and imposed hands on them, they sent them forth.
<sup class="v">13:4</sup>They, therefore, being sent forth by the
Holy Spirit went down to Seleucia, and thence sailed to Cyprus;
<sup class="v">13:5</sup>and coming to Salamis, they preached the
word of God in the synagogues of the Jews; and they also had John
for a servant.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">13:6</sup>And having gone through
the whole island to Paphos, they found a certain magian, a false
prophet, a Jew, whose name was Barjesus, <sup class=
"v">13:7</sup>who was with the proconsul Sergius Paulus, an
intelligent man. This man having called for Barnabas and Saul
desired to hear the word of God; <sup class="v">13:8</sup>but
Elymas the magian, for so his name is interpreted, opposed them,
seeking to turn away the proconsul from the faith. <sup class=
"v">13:9</sup>But Saul, [called] also Paul, filled with the Holy
Spirit, looking steadily at him <sup class="v">13:10</sup>said, O
full of all deceit and all craft, son of a devil, enemy of all
righteousness, will you not cease to pervert the right ways of the
Lord? <sup class="v">13:11</sup>And now, behold, the hand of the
Lord is upon you, and you shall be blind, not seeing the sun for a
season. And immediately there fell upon him a mist and darkness,
and going about he sought guides. <sup class="v">13:12</sup>Then
the proconsul seeing what was done believed, and was astonished at
the teaching of the Lord.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">13:13</sup>And those with Paul,
sailing from Paphos, went to Perga in Pamphylia; but John left them
and returned to Jerusalem. <sup class="v">13:14</sup>And passing on
from Perga, they went to Antioch in Pisidia, and going into the
synagogue on the Sabbath they sat down. <sup class=
"v">13:15</sup>And after the reading of the law and the prophets,
the synagogue rulers sent to them, saying, Men and brothers, if you
have any word of exhortation for the people, speak.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">13:16</sup>And Paul stood up, and
motioning with his hand, said, Men of Israel, and you that fear
God, hear. <sup class="v">13:17</sup>The God of this people chose
our fathers, and raised up the people in the exile in the land of
Egypt, and brought them out of it with a high arm. <sup class=
"v">13:18</sup>And when he had borne with their conduct forty years
in the wilderness, <sup class="v">13:19</sup>and had destroyed
seven nations in the land of Canaan, he distributed their land to
them by lot. <sup class="v">13:20</sup>And after this he gave
judges four hundred and fifty years till Samuel the prophet.
<sup class="v">13:21</sup>And then they asked for a king, and God
gave them Saul the son Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, forty
years; <sup class="v">13:22</sup>and removing him, he raised up for
them David for a king, of whom also he said and testified, I have
found David, the son of Jesse, a man after my heart, who will do
all my will.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">13:23</sup>Of the posterity of
this man, according to his promise, has God raised up to Israel a
Saviour, Jesus; <sup class="v">13:24</sup>John having preached
before his coming the baptism of a change of mind to all the people
of Israel. <sup class="v">13:25</sup>And when John completed his
course, he said, Who do you suppose I am? I am not [the Christ];
but behold, there comes after me one the sandal of whose feet I am
not worthy to untie.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">13:26</sup>Men and brothers,
children of the race of Abraham, and you that fear God, the word of
this salvation is sent to you. <sup class="v">13:27</sup>For those
living at Jerusalem, and their rulers, not knowing him and the
words of the prophets which are read every sabbath, fulfilled them
by condemning [him]; <sup class="v">13:28</sup>and [although] they
found no cause of death [in him], they requested of Pilate that he
might be destroyed; <sup class="v">13:29</sup>and when they had
performed all things written of him, they took him down from the
cross and placed him in a tomb. <sup class="v">13:30</sup>But God
raised him from the dead, <sup class="v">13:31</sup>and he appeared
many days to those who went up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem,
who are now his witnesses to the people. <sup class=
"v">13:32</sup>And we declare to you the good news of the promise
made to the fathers, <sup class="v">13:33</sup>that God has
fulfilled this to us their children in raising up Jesus, as it is
written also in the first psalm, You are my son, to-day have I
begotten you. <sup class="v">13:34</sup>And that he raised him from
the dead never more to return to destruction, he said thus; I will
give you the sure promises of David. <sup class=
"v">13:35</sup>Wherefore also in another place he says, Thou wilt
not suffer thy holy one to see destruction. <sup class=
"v">13:36</sup>For David, having in his generation served the will
of God, fell asleep, and was gathered to his fathers and saw
destruction; <sup class="v">13:37</sup>but he whom God raised up
saw not destruction. <sup class="v">13:38</sup>Be it known to you
therefore, men and brothers, that through this man is preached to
you the forgiveness of sins, <sup class="v">13:39</sup>and every
one who believes is justified by him from all things from which you
could not be justified by the law of Moses. <sup class=
"v">13:40</sup>See then that what is said by the prophets does not
come upon you; <sup class="v">13:41</sup>Behold, despisers, and
wonder and perish, for I perform a work in your days, a work which
you shall by no means believe even if one declares it to you.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">13:42</sup>And when they had gone
out, [the people] requested that these words might be spoken to
them on the next sabbath. <sup class="v">13:43</sup>And the
congregation being dismissed, many of the Jews and pious proselytes
followed Paul and Barnabas, who gave them additional instructions,
and persuaded them to continue in the grace of God. <sup class=
"v">13:44</sup>And on the following sabbath almost all the city
came together to hear the word of the Lord. <sup class=
"v">13:45</sup>And the Jews seeing the multitudes were filled with
envy, and contradicted the things said by Paul, disputing and
blaspheming. <sup class="v">13:46</sup>And both Paul and Barnabas
speaking boldly said, It was necessary that the word of God should
first be spoken to you; but since you cast it away, and judge
yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold, we turn to the
gentiles. <sup class="v">13:47</sup>For thus has the Lord commanded
us; I have set you for a light of nations, that you should be a
salvation even to the end of the earth. <sup class=
"v">13:48</sup>And the gentiles hearing this rejoiced and glorified
the word of the Lord, and as many as were appointed to eternal life
believed; <sup class="v">13:49</sup>and the word of the Lord was
spread through all the country. <sup class="v">13:50</sup>But the
Jews excited the pious and honorable women, and the first men of
the city, and raised a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and
cast them out from their limits. <sup class="v">13:51</sup>And
shaking off the dust of their feet against them, they went to
Iconium; <sup class="v">13:52</sup>and the disciples were filled
with joy and the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p class="pin">8 <sup class="v">14:1</sup>And at Iconium they
went together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spoke that a
great multitude of the Jews and Greeks believed. <sup class=
"v">14:2</sup>But the unbelieving Jews excited the minds of the
gentiles against the brothers, and made them ill-disposed.
<sup class="v">14:3</sup>Then they spent a long time in speaking
boldly for the Lord, who testified to the word of his grace by
granting miracles and prodigies to be performed by their hands.
<sup class="v">14:4</sup>And the multitude of the city were
divided; some were with the Jews, and some with the apostles.
<sup class="v">14:5</sup>And when a design was formed by the
gentiles and Jews with their rulers to treat them injuriously, and
stone them, <sup class="v">14:6</sup>knowing it, they fled to the
cities of Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe, and the surrounding country,
<sup class="v">14:7</sup>and preached the good news there.</p>
<p class="pin">9 <sup class="v">14:8</sup>And there sat a certain
man at Lystra, infirm in his feet, lame from his birth, who had
never walked. <sup class="v">14:9</sup>This man heard Paul
speaking, who, looking steadily at him and seeing that he had faith
to be cured, <sup class="v">14:10</sup>said with a loud voice,
Stand up erect on your feet. And he leaped, and walked. <sup class=
"v">14:11</sup>And the multitude seeing what Paul did, lifted up
their voice in the language of Lycaonia, saying, The gods have come
down to us in the likeness of men; <sup class="v">14:12</sup>and
they called Barnabas, Jupiter, and Paul, Mercury, because he was a
master of eloquence. <sup class="v">14:13</sup>And the priest of
the Jupiter which was before the city brought bulls and garlands to
the gates, and wished to offer sacrifices with the multitudes.
<sup class="v">14:14</sup>But the apostles Barnabas and Paul
hearing of it, rending their clothes ran among the multitude,
crying <sup class="v">14:15</sup>and saying, Men, why do you do
these things? We are also men subject to like sufferings with you,
preaching that you should turn from these vain [services] to the
living God, who made heaven and earth, and the sea, and all things
in them, <sup class="v">14:16</sup>who in past generations
permitted all nations to walk in their own ways; <sup class=
"v">14:17</sup>although indeed he left not himself without a
witness, doing good, giving rains from heaven and fruitful seasons,
filling our hearts with food and gladness. <sup class=
"v">14:18</sup>And saying these things they with difficulty
restrained the multitudes from sacrificing to them.</p>
<p class="pin">10 <sup class="v">14:19</sup>But Jews came from
Antioch and Iconium, and having persuaded the multitudes, and
having stoned Paul, they dragged him out of the city, supposing
that he was dead. <sup class="v">14:20</sup>But while the disciples
stood around him, he arose and entered into the city. And on the
next day he went away with Barnabas to Derbe. <sup class=
"v">14:21</sup>And having preached the good news to that city, and
made many disciples, they returned to Lystra, and Iconium, and
Antioch, <sup class="v">14:22</sup>confirming the souls of the
disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that
through many afflictions we must enter into the kingdom of God.
<sup class="v">14:23</sup>And having appointed them elders in every
church, and having prayed with fasting, they commended them to the
Lord in whom they had believed.</p>
<p class="pin">11 <sup class="v">14:24</sup>And passing through
Pisidia they came to Pamphylia, <sup class="v">14:25</sup>and
having spoken the word in Perga they went down to Attalia,
<sup class="v">14:26</sup>and thence sailed to Antioch, whence they
had been commended to the favor of God for the work which they
performed. <sup class="v">14:27</sup>And having arrived, and
assembled the church, they reported what God had done with them,
and that he had opened the door of faith to the gentiles.
<sup class="v">14:28</sup>And they remained there not a little time
with the disciples.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>
<h3>THE COUNCIL AT JERUSALEM ON CIRCUMCISION.&mdash;A.D. 50.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">15:1</sup>AND certain persons
having come down from Judea taught the brothers, If you are not
circumcised according to the custom of Moses you cannot be saved.
<sup class="v">15:2</sup>There being therefore no little dissension
and disputation of Paul and Barnabas with them, they determined
that Paul and Barnabas and some others of them should go up to the
apostles and elders at Jerusalem, concerning this question.
<sup class="v">15:3</sup>They, therefore, being sent forward by the
church, went to Phenicia and Samaria, relating the conversion of
the gentiles, and caused great joy to all the brothers. <sup class=
"v">15:4</sup>And when they came to Jerusalem they were received by
the church, and the apostles, and the elders, and related what
things God had done with them. <sup class="v">15:5</sup>But some of
those of the sect of the Pharisees who had believed, rose and said,
that it is necessary to circumcise them, and to command them to
keep the law of Moses.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">15:6</sup>And the apostles and
elders were assembled together to see about this matter.
<sup class="v">15:7</sup>And after there had been much debate,
Peter rose and said to them, Men and brothers, you know that in
former days God chose among you that the gentiles should hear by my
mouth the word of the gospel and believe. <sup class=
"v">15:8</sup>And the heart-searching God testified to them, giving
to them the Holy Spirit even as to us, <sup class="v">15:9</sup>and
made no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by
the faith. <sup class="v">15:10</sup>Now, therefore, why do you try
God, to put on the necks of the disciples a yoke which neither our
fathers nor we could bear? <sup class="v">15:11</sup>But we believe
that we shall be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus in the
same manner as they.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">15:12</sup>And all the multitude
was silent, and heard Barnabas and Paul relate what miracles and
prodigies God performed among the gentiles through them.
<sup class="v">15:13</sup>And after they were silent, James
answered, saying, Men and brothers, hear me. <sup class=
"v">15:14</sup>Simeon has related how God first visited the
gentiles to take a people for his name. <sup class=
"v">15:15</sup>And with this agree the words of the prophets, as it
is written, <sup class="v">15:16</sup>After this will I return and
build up the tabernacle of David which had fallen down, and rebuild
its ruins, and set it up, <sup class="v">15:17</sup>that the rest
of men may seek the Lord, even all the nations on whom my name has
been called, says the Lord who does these things, <sup class=
"v">15:18</sup>known from eternity. <sup class=
"v">15:19</sup>Wherefore I judge that we ought not to trouble those
who turned to God from the gentiles, <sup class="v">15:20</sup>but
to send to them to abstain from things sacrificed to idols, and
fornication, and things strangled, and blood. <sup class=
"v">15:21</sup>For Moses from ancient times has those who preach
him in every city, being read in the synagogues every sabbath.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">15:22</sup>Then it seemed good to
the apostles and elders, with all the assembly [the church], to
send delegates from themselves to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas,
Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, leading men among the brothers,
<sup class="v">15:23</sup>writing by their hand, The apostles and
elders and brothers, to the brothers in Antioch and Syria and
Cilicia, who are of the gentiles, greeting. <sup class=
"v">15:24</sup>Since we heard that some going out from us have
troubled you with words subverting your souls, to whom we gave no
charge, <sup class="v">15:25</sup>it seemed good to us, being of
one opinion, to send delegates to you with our beloved Barnabas and
Paul, <sup class="v">15:26</sup>men who have hazarded their lives
for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. <sup class="v">15:27</sup>We
have sent, therefore, Judas and Silas, and they will tell you the
same things by word. <sup class="v">15:28</sup>For it seemed good
to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to put no greater burden upon you
except these necessary things; <sup class="v">15:29</sup>that you
should abstain from things sacrificed to idols, and blood, and
things strangled, and fornication, from which if you keep
yourselves you will do well. Farewell.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">15:30</sup>They, therefore, being
dismissed went to Antioch, and assembling the multitude delivered
the epistle. <sup class="v">15:31</sup>And reading it they rejoiced
at the exhortation. <sup class="v">15:32</sup>And Judas and Silas
being themselves also prophets, exhorted the brothers with much
argument, and confirmed them. <sup class="v">15:33</sup>And having
staid [some] time, they were dismissed in peace by the brothers to
those that sent them. <sup class="v">15:35</sup>But Paul and
Barnabas remained at Antioch, teaching and preaching with many
others the word of the Lord.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
<h3>PAUL'S SECOND MISSION TO ASIA MINOR.&mdash;A.D. 51-52.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">15:36</sup>AND after some days
Paul said to Barnabas, Let us return and visit the brothers in
every city in which we preached the word of the Lord, [and see] how
they do. <sup class="v">15:37</sup>And Barnabas wished to take with
them John called Mark; <sup class="v">15:38</sup>but Paul thought
not best to take with them one who deserted them at Pamphylia and
did not go with them to the work. <sup class="v">15:39</sup>And
there was a sharp contention, so that they separated from each
other; and Barnabas taking Mark sailed to Cyprus.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">15:40</sup>But Paul choosing
Silas went out, commended to the favor of the Lord by the brothers.
<sup class="v">15:41</sup>And he passed through Syria and Cilicia
confirming the churches. <sup class="v">16:1</sup>And he went to
Derbe and Lystra. And behold, there was a certain disciple there by
the name of Timothy, a son of a Jewish woman, a believer, but of a
Greek father, <sup class="v">16:2</sup>who was commended by the
brothers in Lystra and Iconium. <sup class="v">16:3</sup>Him Paul
wished to have go with him; and he took and circumcised him on
account of the Jews who were in those places; for all knew that his
father was a Greek.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">16:4</sup>And when he went
through the cities he gave them the ordinances to observe which had
been determined by the apostles and elders at Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">16:5</sup>Then the churches were
strengthened in the faith, and increased in number daily.
<sup class="v">16:6</sup>And passing through Phrygia and the
country of Galatia, being forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the
word in Asia, <sup class="v">16:7</sup>coming by Mysia they
endeavored to go into Bithynia; and the Spirit of Jesus did not
permit them; <sup class="v">16:8</sup>and passing by Mysia they
went down to Troas. <sup class="v">16:9</sup>And a vision appeared
by night to Paul; a certain man of Macedonia standing, asking him,
and saying, Come over into Macedonia and help us. <sup class=
"v">16:10</sup>And when he saw the vision we immediately sought to
go into Macedonia, concluding that the Lord had called us to preach
the good news to them.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
<h3>PAUL AND HIS COMPANY AT PHILIPPI ON THEIR FIRST MISSION TO
EUROPE.&mdash;A.D. 52-53.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">16:11</sup>AND sailing from Troas
we came in a direct course to Samothracia, and on the next day to
Neapolis, <sup class="v">16:12</sup>and thence to Philippi, which
is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, [and] a colony. And we
spent some days in that city. <sup class="v">16:13</sup>And on the
sabbath we went out of the gate, by the river, where the proseuche
[place of prayer] usually was, and sitting down we spoke to the
women who came together. <sup class="v">16:14</sup>And a certain
woman by the name of Lydia, a dealer in purple, of the city of
Thyatira, who worshipped God, heard, whose heart the Lord opened to
attend to the [words] spoken by Paul.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">16:15</sup>And when she was
baptized, and her house, she requested saying, If you have judged
me faithful to the Lord, come into my house and stay; and she
constrained us.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">16:16</sup>And when we went to
the proseuche, a certain female servant having a spirit, a diviner,
met us, who brought her masters much gain by divining. <sup class=
"v">16:17</sup>She following Paul and us, cried, saying, These men
are servants of the Most High God, who declare to us the way of
salvation; <sup class="v">16:18</sup>and this she did for many
days. And Paul being grieved turned around and said to the spirit,
I command you, in the name of Jesus Christ, to come out of her. And
it came out of her in that hour. <sup class="v">16:19</sup>And her
masters seeing that the hope of their gain was gone, seizing Paul
and Silas dragged them to the market, to the rulers, <sup class=
"v">16:20</sup>and bringing them before the prefects said, These
men, being Jews, greatly trouble the city, <sup class=
"v">16:21</sup>and preach customs which it is not lawful for us,
being Romans, to receive or observe. <sup class="v">16:22</sup>And
the multitude came together against them, and the prefects tearing
off their clothes gave orders to beat them with rods, <sup class=
"v">16:23</sup>and having inflicted many blows on them cast them
into prison, charging the jailer to keep them safely; <sup class=
"v">16:24</sup>who, having received such a charge, cast them into
the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">16:25</sup>But at midnight Paul
and Silas prayed and sung praises to God, and the prisoners heard
them. <sup class="v">16:26</sup>And suddenly there was a great
earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and
all the doors were immediately opened, and the bands of all were
removed. <sup class="v">16:27</sup>And the jailer awaking from
sleep and seeing the doors of the prison opened, drew his sword and
was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had
escaped. <sup class="v">16:28</sup>But Paul cried with a loud
voice, saying, Do yourself no harm, for we are all here.
<sup class="v">16:29</sup>And asking for a light he sprang in, and
fell down trembling before Paul and Silas, <sup class=
"v">16:30</sup>and bringing them out said, Sirs, what must I do to
be saved? <sup class="v">16:31</sup>And they said, Believe on the
Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved, and your house. <sup class=
"v">16:32</sup>And they spoke the word of the Lord to him and all
those in his house.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">16:33</sup>And taking them that
hour of the night, he washed them from their stripes, and was
baptized, he and all his, immediately, <sup class=
"v">16:34</sup>and conducting them up into his house he set a
table, and rejoiced with all his house, having believed in God.
<sup class="v">16:35</sup>And when it was day the prefects sent the
lictors, saying, Let those men go. <sup class="v">16:36</sup>And
the jailer told these words to Paul; The prefects have sent to let
you go; now, therefore, go, and depart in peace.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">16:37</sup>But Paul said to him,
They have beaten us publicly uncondemned, being Romans, and cast us
into prison; and now do they privately cast us out? No, indeed: but
let them come themselves and conduct us out. <sup class=
"v">16:38</sup>And the lictors told these words to the prefects,
and they were afraid when they heard that they were Romans;
<sup class="v">16:39</sup>and they came and besought them, and
conducting them out desired them to leave the city. <sup class=
"v">16:40</sup>And going out of the prison they entered into the
house of Lydia, and having seen the brothers they exhorted them,
and departed.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>
<h3>PAUL AND HIS COMPANY AT THESSALONICA, BEREA, AND
ATHENS.&mdash;A.D. 53.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">17:1</sup>AND travelling through
Amphipolis and Apollonia they came to Thessalonica, where there was
a synagogue of the Jews. <sup class="v">17:2</sup>And according to
his custom Paul went in to them, and reasoned with them three
sabbaths from the Scriptures, <sup class="v">17:3</sup>explaining
and asserting that the Christ ought to suffer and to rise from the
dead; and that this Jesus whom I preach to you is the Christ.
<sup class="v">17:4</sup>And some of them believed and adhered to
Paul and Silas; of the pious Greeks a great multitude, and of the
chief women not a few. <sup class="v">17:5</sup>But the unbelieving
Jews taking certain base men of those about the markets, and
exciting a mob, disturbed the city; and coming to the house of
Jason sought to bring them out to the people; <sup class=
"v">17:6</sup>but not finding them, they dragged Jason and some
brothers to the rulers of the city, crying, These men who have
turned the world upside down have come here also, <sup class=
"v">17:7</sup>and Jason has received them; and they all do things
contrary to the ordinances of C&aelig;sar, saying that there is
another king, Jesus. <sup class="v">17:8</sup>And they excited the
multitude and the rulers of the city hearing these things,
<sup class="v">17:9</sup>and taking security of Jason and the rest
they let them go.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">17:10</sup>And the brothers
immediately, by night, sent away Paul and Silas to Berea; and when
they came they went into the synagogue of the Jews; <sup class=
"v">17:11</sup>but these were more noble than those in
Thessalonica, for they received the word with all readiness,
examining the Scriptures daily [to see] if these things were so.
<sup class="v">17:12</sup>Many of them therefore believed, both of
honorable Grecian women, and of men not a few. <sup class=
"v">17:13</sup>And when the Jews in Thessalonica knew that the word
of God was preached by Paul at Berea, they came there exciting the
multitudes.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">17:14</sup>Then the brothers
immediately sent Paul away, as if to go by sea; but Silas and
Timothy remained there. <sup class="v">17:15</sup>And those
conducting Paul brought him to Athens, and receiving a charge to
Silas and Timothy to come to him as soon as possible, they
departed.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">17:16</sup>And while Paul waited
for them at Athens, his spirit was moved within him as he saw the
city wholly devoted to idolatry. <sup class="v">17:17</sup>Then he
reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and those that were pious,
and in the market every day with those he met. <sup class=
"v">17:18</sup>And some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers
disputed with him, and some said, What does this trifler mean to
say? And others, He seems to be a preacher of strange demons;
because he preached to them Jesus and the resurrection. <sup class=
"v">17:19</sup>And laying hold of him they brought him to the
Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new teaching is which is
taught by you? <sup class="v">17:20</sup>for you bring certain
strange things to our ears; we wish therefore to know what these
things mean. <sup class="v">17:21</sup>And all the Athenians and
the strangers living there spend their leisure in nothing else but
telling or hearing something new.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">17:22</sup>And Paul standing in
the midst of the Areopagus said, Men of Athens, I perceive that in
all things you are extremely devoted to the worship of demons.
<sup class="v">17:23</sup>For as I passed through, and observed
your objects of worship, I found also an altar on which was
inscribed, TO AN UNKNOWN GOD. What therefore you worship as
unknown, this I declare to you. <sup class="v">17:24</sup>The God
who made the world and all things in it, this [God] being Lord of
heaven and earth dwells not in temples made with hands, <sup class=
"v">17:25</sup>neither is he served by the hands of men as needing
any thing, since he gives to all life, and breath, and all things;
<sup class="v">17:26</sup>and he made of one blood every nation of
men to live on all the face of the earth, determining their
appointed times and the bounds of their habitation, <sup class=
"v">17:27</sup>that they should seek God, if perhaps they might
feel after and find him, and indeed he is not far from every one of
us. <sup class="v">17:28</sup>For in him we live, and move, and
are; as some also of your own poets have said, For we are his
offspring. <sup class="v">17:29</sup>Being therefore an offspring
of God, we ought not to think the Deity to be like gold or silver
or stone, a work of art and human device.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">17:30</sup>Overlooking therefore
the times of ignorance, God now commands all men everywhere to
change their minds, <sup class="v">17:31</sup>because he has
appointed a day in which he is about to judge the world in
righteousness, by the man whom he has appointed, giving assurance
to all by raising him from the dead. <sup class="v">17:32</sup>But
when they heard of a resurrection of the dead, some scoffed; but
others said, We will hear you again of this. <sup class=
"v">17:33</sup>So Paul went out from the midst of them; <sup class=
"v">17:34</sup>but certain men adhering to him believed, among whom
were Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and
others with them.</p>

<h3>PAUL AND HIS COMPANY AT CORINTH, HIS VISIT TO SYRIA AND ASIA
MINOR.&mdash;A.D. 53-55.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">18:1</sup>AND after this Paul
left Athens and came to Corinth. <sup class="v">18:2</sup>And
finding a certain Jew by the name of Aquila, a native of Pontus,
who had recently come from Italy, and his wife Priscilla, because
Claudius had ordered all the Jews to leave Rome, he went to them,
<sup class="v">18:3</sup>and because he was of the same trade
continued and labored with them; for they were tent makers.
<sup class="v">18:4</sup>And he reasoned in the synagogue every
sabbath, and persuaded both Jews and Greeks.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">18:5</sup>And when Silas and
Timothy came from Macedonia, Paul gave himself wholly to preaching
the word, testifying to the Jews Christ Jesus. <sup class=
"v">18:6</sup>But when they disputed and blasphemed, shaking his
garments he said to them, Your blood be upon your heads; I, pure,
from this time will go to the gentiles.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">18:7</sup>And departing thence he
came into the house of a man called Justus, who worshipped God, and
whose house adjoined the synagogue. <sup class="v">18:8</sup>And
Crispus the synagogue ruler believed in the Lord, with all his
house; and many of the Corinthians who heard believed and were
baptized. <sup class="v">18:9</sup>And the Lord said to Paul, in a
vision by night, Fear not, but speak and be not silent, <sup class=
"v">18:10</sup>for I am with you; and no one shall attack you to
hurt you, for I have many people in this city. <sup class=
"v">18:11</sup>And he remained there a year and six months,
teaching among them the word of God.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">18:12</sup>And when Gallio was
proconsul of Achaia, the Jews rose with one consent against Paul
and brought him to the tribunal, <sup class="v">18:13</sup>saying,
This man persuades men to worship God contrary to the law.
<sup class="v">18:14</sup>And when Paul was about to open his mouth
Gallio said to the Jews, If there was any injustice or evil
imposition, O Jews, I would bear with you in a reasonable manner;
<sup class="v">18:15</sup>but if it is a question of doctrine, and
of names, and of your law, look to it yourselves; for I will not be
a judge of these things. <sup class="v">18:16</sup>And he drove
them from the tribunal. <sup class="v">18:17</sup>And they all took
Sosthenes the synagogue-ruler and beat him before the tribunal; and
Gallio cared for none of these things.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">18:18</sup>And Paul having
remained yet many days took leave of the brothers, and sailed to
Syria; and Priscilla was with him, and Aquila, having shaved his
head at Cenchrea; for he had a vow. <sup class="v">18:19</sup>And
they came to Ephesus, and he left them there, and entering himself
into the synagogue reasoned with the Jews. <sup class=
"v">18:20</sup>And they asking him to stay a longer time with them
he did not consent, <sup class="v">18:21</sup>but taking leave of
them and saying, I will return to you again, if God will, he sailed
from, Ephesus, <sup class="v">18:22</sup>and coming down to
C&aelig;sarea, and going up and saluting the church, he went down
to Antioch; <sup class="v">18:23</sup>and having spent some time
there he went away, passing in order through the country of Galatia
and Phrygia, confirming all the disciples.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>
<h3>PAUL AT EPHESUS.&mdash;A.D. 55-58.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">18:24</sup>AND a certain Jew by
the name of Apollos, an Alexandrian by birth, an eloquent man, came
to Ephesus, being powerful in the Scriptures. <sup class=
"v">18:25</sup>This man was instructed in the way of the Lord, and
being fervent in spirit spoke and taught correctly the doctrines
concerning Jesus, knowing only the baptism of John; <sup class=
"v">18:26</sup>and this man began to speak boldly in the synagogue,
and Priscilla and Aquila hearing him took him and taught him more
accurately the way. <sup class="v">18:27</sup>And he wishing to go
into Achaia, the brothers sent him, and wrote to the disciples to
receive him. And when he came he helped those much who had believed
through the grace; <sup class="v">18:28</sup>for he argued
powerfully against the Jews, publicly showing by the Scriptures
that Jesus is the Christ.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">19:1</sup>And when Apollos was at
Corinth, Paul, passing through the higher portions of the country,
came to Ephesus, and found certain disciples; <sup class=
"v">19:2</sup>and he said to them, Have you received the Holy
Spirit since you believed? And they said to him, We have not heard
that there is a Holy Spirit. <sup class="v">19:3</sup>And he said
to them, With what then were you baptized? And they said, With
John's baptism. <sup class="v">19:4</sup>Paul said, John indeed
baptized [administered] the baptism of a change of mind, telling
the people to believe on him that was to come after him, that is,
on Jesus. <sup class="v">19:5</sup>And hearing this they were
baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus: <sup class=
"v">19:6</sup>and Paul putting his hands on them, the Holy Spirit
came on them, and they spoke with tongues and prophesied.
<sup class="v">19:7</sup>And all the men were about twelve.</p>
<p class="pin"></p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">19:8</sup>And going into the
synagogue he spoke boldly, for three months, reasoning and
persuading in favor of the kingdom of God. <sup class=
"v">19:9</sup>But when some were hardened and believed not,
speaking evil of the way before the multitude, he left them and
separated the disciples from them, and reasoned day by day in the
school of one Tyrannus. <sup class="v">19:10</sup>And this was done
for two years, so that all who lived in Asia heard the word of the
Lord, both Jews and Greeks.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">19:11</sup>And God performed
unusual miracles by the hands of Paul, <sup class="v">19:12</sup>so
that napkins and aprons were brought from him to the sick, and
their diseases left them, and the evil spirits went out of them.
<sup class="v">19:13</sup>And some of the travelling Jewish
exorcists undertook to call over those that had evil spirits the
name of the Lord Jesus, saying, I adjure you by the Jesus whom Paul
preaches. <sup class="v">19:14</sup>And there were some seven sons
of Sceva, a Jew, a chief priest, who did this. <sup class=
"v">19:15</sup>But the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know,
and Paul I know, but who are you? <sup class="v">19:16</sup>And the
man in whom the evil spirit was leaped upon them, and overcome
them, and prevailed against them, so that they escaped from his
house, naked and wounded. <sup class="v">19:17</sup>And this was
known both to all the Jews and Greeks who lived at Ephesus, and
fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was
magnified; <sup class="v">19:18</sup>and many of those who believed
came and confessed, and showed their practices. <sup class=
"v">19:19</sup>And many of those who practised secret arts brought
their books, and burnt them before all; and they computed the price
of them, and found it to be fifty thousand [didrachmas] of silver
[$8,333]. <sup class="v">19:20</sup>So the word of the Lord
increased powerfully and prevailed.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">19:21</sup>And when these things
were accomplished, Paul was disposed by the Spirit, passing through
Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been
there I must see Rome. <sup class="v">19:22</sup>And sending two
that served him into Macedonia, Timothy and Erastus, he continued a
time in Asia.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">19:23</sup>And there was at that
time no small tumult about the way [of the Lord]. <sup class=
"v">19:24</sup>For a certain Demetrius by name, a silversmith, who
made silver temples of Diana, and afforded his artisans no small
gain, <sup class="v">19:25</sup>assembling them together and
laborers of like employments, said, Men, you know that our
prosperity is derived from this employment, <sup class=
"v">19:26</sup>and you see and hear, that not only at Ephesus, but
in almost all Asia, this Paul has led away a great multitude by
persuasion, saying that things which are made by hands are not
gods. <sup class="v">19:27</sup>And not only this work of ours is
in danger of coming into contempt, but even the temple of the great
goddess Diana of being set at nought, and her majesty also which
all Asia and the world worships, of being destroyed.</p>
<p class="pin">8 <sup class="v">19:28</sup>And hearing this they
were full of wrath, and cried, saying, Great is Diana of the
Ephesians! <sup class="v">19:29</sup>And the whole city was full of
confusion; and they rushed with one accord to the theatre, taking
Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians, fellow travellers of Paul.
<sup class="v">19:30</sup>And Paul wishing to go in to the people,
the disciples did not permit him; <sup class="v">19:31</sup>and
some of the rulers of Asia also, who were friendly to him, sending
to him, besought him not to expose himself in the theatre.
<sup class="v">19:32</sup>Some therefore cried one thing, and some
another; for the assembly was confused, and the greater part knew
not for what reason they had come together. <sup class=
"v">19:33</sup>And they advanced Alexander from the multitude, the
Jews putting him forward; and Alexander motioning with his hand,
wished to defend himself before the people. <sup class=
"v">19:34</sup>But knowing that he was a Jew, there was one voice
from all, for about two hours, crying, Great is Diana of the
Ephesians.</p>
<p class="pin">9 <sup class="v">19:35</sup>And the clerk having
stilled the multitude, said, Men of Ephesus, what man is there who
does not know that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the
great Diana, and of the Jove descended [image]? <sup class=
"v">19:36</sup>These things therefore being indisputable, it is
best to be quiet, and do nothing rashly. <sup class=
"v">19:37</sup>For you have brought these men here, who are neither
temple-robbers nor blasphemers of your goddess. <sup class=
"v">19:38</sup>If, therefore, Demetrius and the artisans with him
have a charge against any, court days are held, and there are
pro-consuls; let them accuse one another. <sup class=
"v">19:39</sup>And if you desire any thing of other matters, let it
be determined in a lawful assembly. <sup class="v">19:40</sup>For
we are in danger of being called to account for the tumult of
to-day, there being no cause by which we can excuse this concourse.
<sup class="v">19:41</sup>And having said these words he dismissed
the assembly.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>
<h3>PAUL'S VISIT TO GREECE AND MACEDONIA AND HIS RETURN TO
MILETUS.&mdash;A.D. 58, 59.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">20:1</sup>AFTER the tumult was
allayed, Paul calling the disciples and embracing them departed to
go into Macedonia. <sup class="v">20:2</sup>And going through those
parts, and exhorting them with many words, he went into Greece;
<sup class="v">20:3</sup>and when he had staid there three months,
and a conspiracy was formed against him by the Jews as he was about
to sail to Syria, he determined to return through Macedonia.
<sup class="v">20:4</sup>And there followed him to Asia, Sopater
the son of Pyrrhus of Berea, and of those of Thessalonica,
Aristarchus and Secundus, and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy, and
those of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus; <sup class=
"v">20:5</sup>these going before waited for us at Troas.
<sup class="v">20:6</sup>And we sailed from Philippi, after the
days of unleavened bread, and came to those at Troas in five days,
where we staid seven days.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">20:7</sup>And on the first day of
the week, we being assembled to break bread, Paul preached to them,
being about to depart on the next day, and continued his discourse
till midnight; <sup class="v">20:8</sup>and there were many lamps
in the upper room where we were assembled. <sup class=
"v">20:9</sup>And a young man by the name of Eutychus sitting in a
window, falling into a deep sleep while Paul preached long, and
being overcome by sleep, fell from the third story down, and was
taken up dead. <sup class="v">20:10</sup>But Paul going down fell
on him, and embracing him, said, Be not troubled, for his life is
in him. <sup class="v">20:11</sup>And going up and breaking bread,
and tasting it, and conversing a long time till the break of day,
he departed. <sup class="v">20:12</sup>And they brought away the
child alive, and were not a little comforted.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">20:13</sup>And we going before by
ship sailed to Assos, being about to take in Paul at that place;
for so had he appointed, being about to go on foot himself.
<sup class="v">20:14</sup>And when he met us at Assos, we took him
in and came to Mitylene, <sup class="v">20:15</sup>and sailing
thence, on the next day we came opposite to Chios, and in another
day we touched at Samos, and stopping at Trogylium, on the day
following we came to Miletus. <sup class="v">20:16</sup>For Paul
had determined to sail by Ephesus, that it might not be necessary
for him to spend a long time in Asia; for he hastened, if it was
possible for him, to be at Jerusalem at the day of Pentecost.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">20:17</sup>And from Miletus
sending to Ephesus he called for the elders of the church.
<sup class="v">20:18</sup>And when they had come to him, he said to
them, You know from the first day that I came into Asia, how I was
with you at all times, <sup class="v">20:19</sup>serving the Lord
with all humility, and tears and trials that befell me by the
conspiracies of the Jews, <sup class="v">20:20</sup>how I kept not
back from declaring to you and teaching you publicly and from house
to house any thing that was profitable, <sup class=
"v">20:21</sup>testifying both to Jews and Greeks the change of
mind to God, and the faith in our Lord Jesus. <sup class=
"v">20:22</sup>And behold now, I go constrained by the Spirit to
Jerusalem, not knowing the things which shall befall me there,
<sup class="v">20:23</sup>except that the Holy Spirit testifies to
me in every city, saying, That bonds and afflictions await me.
<sup class="v">20:24</sup>But life precious to myself, I make of no
account that I may finish my course and the service which I
received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of
God.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">20:25</sup>And now, behold, I
know that you all among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom
shall see my face no more. <sup class="v">20:26</sup>Wherefore I
call you to witness this day, that I am pure from the blood of all
men; <sup class="v">20:27</sup>for I have not kept back from
declaring to you all the counsel of God. <sup class=
"v">20:28</sup>Take heed to yourselves, therefore, and to all the
flock in which the Holy Spirit has made you bishops, to feed the
church of the Lord which he has purchased with his blood.
<sup class="v">20:29</sup>For I know that after my departure
grievous wolves will come among you, not sparing the flock,
<sup class="v">20:30</sup>and of yourselves men will arise speaking
perverse things, to draw away disciples after them. <sup class=
"v">20:31</sup>Wherefore watch, remembering that for three years,
night and day, I ceased not to admonish every one of you with
tears. <sup class="v">20:32</sup>And now I commend you to God, and
the word of his grace, who is able to build you up and to give you
an inheritance with all the sanctified. <sup class="v">20:33</sup>I
have coveted no man's silver or gold or clothing; <sup class=
"v">20:34</sup>you yourselves know that these hands have served my
necessities and those with me. <sup class="v">20:35</sup>I have
showed you all things, that so laboring you ought to help the weak,
and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that he said, It is
more blessed to give than to receive.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">20:36</sup>And having said these
words he kneeled down, and prayed with them all. <sup class=
"v">20:37</sup>And they all wept much, and fell on Paul's neck and
kissed him, <sup class="v">20:38</sup>grieving most of all for the
word which he said, that they should see his face no more. And they
accompanied him to the ship.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>
<h3>PAUL AND HIS COMPANY PURSUING THEIR JOURNEY TO C&AElig;SAREA
AND JERUSALEM, ETC.&mdash;A.D. 59.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">21:1</sup>AND when we had torn
ourselves from them we set sail, and going in a straight course
came to Cos, and on the next day to Rhodes, and thence to Patara.
<sup class="v">21:2</sup>And finding a ship crossing to Phenicia,
going on board we set sail. <sup class="v">21:3</sup>And observing
Cyprus, and leaving it on the left, we sailed to Syria, and landed
at Tyre; for there the ship was to discharge her cargo. <sup class=
"v">21:4</sup>And finding the disciples we continued there seven
days; and they told Paul, by the Spirit, not to go on to Jerusalem.
<sup class="v">21:5</sup>And when we had completed the days we went
out and proceeded on our journey, they all attending us with their
wives and children till without the city, and kneeling down on the
shore we prayed, <sup class="v">21:6</sup>and having saluted each
other we went to the ship, and they returned to their homes.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">21:7</sup>Having completed our
voyage from Tyre we went to Ptolemais, and having saluted the
brothers continued with them one day. <sup class="v">21:8</sup>And
departing on the next day we came to C&aelig;sarea, and going to
the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, we
staid with him. <sup class="v">21:9</sup>This man had four virgin
daughters who prophesied. <sup class="v">21:10</sup>And having
continued there many days, there came down a certain prophet from
Judea by the name of Agabus, <sup class="v">21:11</sup>and coming
to us, and taking Paul's girdle, and binding his hands and feet, he
said, These things, says the Holy Spirit; Thus will the Jews at
Jerusalem bind the man that owns this girdle, and deliver him into
the hands of the gentiles. <sup class="v">21:12</sup>And when we
heard these things, we and the people of the place besought him not
to go up to Jerusalem. <sup class="v">21:13</sup>But Paul answered,
What do you do, to weep and break my heart? For I am ready not only
to be bound, but also to die at Jerusalem, for the name of the Lord
Jesus. <sup class="v">21:14</sup>And he not being persuaded, we
were silent, saying, The will of the Lord be done.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">21:15</sup>And after these days,
having made preparation, we went up to Jerusalem; <sup class=
"v">21:16</sup>and some of the disciples from C&aelig;sarea went up
with us, conducting [us] to Mnason a Cyprian, an early disciple
with whom we lodged.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">21:17</sup>And when we arrived at
Jerusalem the brothers received us gladly. <sup class=
"v">21:18</sup>And on the following day Paul went with us to James,
and all the elders were present. <sup class="v">21:19</sup>And
having saluted them, he related particularly what God had done
among the gentiles by his ministry; <sup class="v">21:20</sup>and
having heard, they glorified God, and said to him, You see,
brother, how many ten thousands there are of those who have
believed, among the Jews, and all are zealots of the law;
<sup class="v">21:21</sup>and they have been informed of you, that
you teach all the Jews among the gentiles to apostatize from Moses,
telling them not to circumcise their children, nor to walk
according to the customs. <sup class="v">21:22</sup>What then is
[to be done]? They will hear everywhere that you have come.
<sup class="v">21:23</sup>Do this, therefore, which we tell you. We
have four men having a vow upon them; <sup class=
"v">21:24</sup>take them and be purified with them, and pay their
expenses, that they may shave their heads, and all will know that
the information which they have of you is not correct, but that you
walk also yourself keeping the law. <sup class="v">21:25</sup>But
concerning the gentiles who have believed, we have sent, judging
that they should avoid things offered to idols, and blood, and
things strangled, and fornication. <sup class="v">21:26</sup>Then
Paul taking the men, on the following day being purified with them
went into the temple, announcing the completion of the days of
purification till an offering should be offered for each one of
them.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2>
<h3>PAUL'S APPREHENSION BY THE JEWS, HIS RESCUE BY THE ROMANS, HIS
ADDRESS, ETC.&mdash;A.D. 59.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">21:27</sup>AND when the seven
days were nearly completed, the Jews from Asia seeing him in the
temple excited all the multitude, and laid hands on him,
<sup class="v">21:28</sup>crying, Men of Israel, help; this is the
man who teaches all men everywhere against the people, and the law,
and this place, and besides he has brought Greeks into the temple,
and defiled this holy place. <sup class="v">21:29</sup>For they had
before seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with him, and
supposed that Paul had brought him into the temple. <sup class=
"v">21:30</sup>And all the city was moved, and there was a
concourse of the people, and taking hold of Paul they dragged him
without the temple, and immediately the gates were shut.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">21:31</sup>And while they were
seeking to kill him, a report went up to the chiliarch of the
cohort that all Jerusalem was in commotion; <sup class=
"v">21:32</sup>who immediately taking soldiers and centurions ran
down upon them; and seeing the chiliarch and the soldiers, they
ceased beating Paul. <sup class="v">21:33</sup>Then the chiliarch
approaching took him, and commanded him to be bound with two
chains, and inquired who he was and what he had done. <sup class=
"v">21:34</sup>But some cried one thing, and some another, in the
multitude, and not being able to learn the truth, on account of the
tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the fortress.
<sup class="v">21:35</sup>And when he was on the steps, it happened
that he was borne by the soldiers, on account of the violence of
the multitude; <sup class="v">21:36</sup>for the multitude of the
people followed, crying, Take him away.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">21:37</sup>And being about to be
carried into the fortress, Paul said to the chiliarch, May I have
permission to speak to you? And he said, Do you understand Greek?
<sup class="v">21:38</sup>Are you not the Egyptian who before these
days excited a sedition, and led out into the wilderness the four
thousand men who were murderers? <sup class="v">21:39</sup>And Paul
said, I am a Jew, of Tarsus of Cilicia, a citizen of a not
undistinguished city, I beg of you, permit me to speak to the
people. <sup class="v">21:40</sup>And he giving him permission,
Paul stood up on the steps, and motioned with his hand to the
people; and when there was great silence, he spoke in the Hebrew
language, and said, <sup class="v">22:1</sup>Men, brothers and
fathers, hear my present defense before you. <sup class=
"v">22:2</sup>And hearing that he spoke to them in the Hebrew
language, they kept the greater silence.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">22:3</sup>And he said, I am a
Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city,
instructed at the feet of Gamaliel in the accurate interpretation
of the law of our fathers, and am a zealous worshipper of God as
you all are to-day; <sup class="v">22:4</sup>and I persecuted this
way to death, binding and committing to prison both men and women,
<sup class="v">22:5</sup>as the chief priest also bears me witness,
and all the eldership, from whom also receiving letters to the
brothers I went to Damascus, to bring those who were there bound to
Jerusalem to be punished.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">22:6</sup>And when I was on the
way and had come nigh to Damascus, about noon suddenly a great
light from heaven shone around me, <sup class="v">22:7</sup>and I
fell on the earth, and heard a voice saying to me, Saul, Saul, why
do you persecute me? <sup class="v">22:8</sup>And I answered, Who
are you, Lord? And he said to me, I am Jesus the Nazoraean, whom
you persecute. <sup class="v">22:9</sup>And those that were with me
saw the light, but they heard not the voice of him that spoke to
me. <sup class="v">22:10</sup>And I said, What shall I do, Lord?
And the Lord said to me, Arise, and go to Damascus, and there it
shall be told you of all things which are appointed for you to
do.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">22:11</sup>And when I could not
see from the brightness of that light, being led by the hand by
those with me, I came to Damascus. <sup class="v">22:12</sup>And a
certain Ananias, a man [living] according to the law, approved by
all the Jews living [there], <sup class="v">22:13</sup>coming and
standing by, said to me, Brother Saul, Receive your sight. And in
that hour I looked upon him. <sup class="v">22:14</sup>And he said,
The God of our fathers chose you to know his will, and to see the
Righteous One, and hear the voice of his mouth, <sup class=
"v">22:15</sup>for you shall be a witness for him to all men of
what you have seen and heard. <sup class="v">22:16</sup>And now,
why do you delay? Arising, baptize and wash away your sins, calling
on his name.</p>
<p class="pin">8 <sup class="v">22:17</sup>And when I returned to
Jerusalem and was praying in the temple, I was in a trance,
<sup class="v">22:18</sup>and saw him [Christ], saying to me,
Hasten and depart immediately from Jerusalem, for they will not
receive your testimony of me. <sup class="v">22:19</sup>And I said,
Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in the synagogues those
who believed on you; <sup class="v">22:20</sup>and when the blood
of your martyr Stephen was poured out, I also stood by and
consented, and kept the clothes of those that killed him.
<sup class="v">22:21</sup>And he said to me, Go, for I will send
you to nations far away.</p>
<p class="pin">9 <sup class="v">22:22</sup>And they heard him to
this word, and lifted up their voice saying, Take away such a man
from the earth; it is not fit that he should live. <sup class=
"v">22:23</sup>And as they cried and rent their clothes and cast
dust in the air, <sup class="v">22:24</sup>the chiliarch commanded
him to be brought into the fortress, ordering that he should be
examined with scourges, that he might know for what reason they
cried so against him. <sup class="v">22:25</sup>But when they
extended him with cords, he said to the centurion standing by, Is
it lawful for you to scourge a man, a Roman, and uncondemned?
<sup class="v">22:26</sup>And the centurion hearing this, went and
told the chiliarch, saying, What are you about to do? for this man
is a Roman. <sup class="v">22:27</sup>And the chiliarch came to him
and said, Tell me, are you a Roman? And he said, Yes. <sup class=
"v">22:28</sup>And the chiliarch answered, I acquired this
citizenship for a great price. But Paul said, I am indeed, and was
also born [one]. <sup class="v">22:29</sup>Then those about to
examine him immediately withdrew from him; and the chiliarch was
afraid, knowing that he was a Roman, and because he had bound
him.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>
<h3>PAUL BEFORE THE SANHEDRIM, AND SENT TO C&AElig;SAREA FOR SAFE
KEEPING.&mdash;A.D. 59.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">22:30</sup>AND on the next day,
wishing to know the truth in respect to what he was accused of by
the Jews, [the chiliarch] released him, and commanded the chief
priests and all the Sanhedrim to come together; and bringing Paul
down he set him before them. <sup class="v">23:1</sup>And Paul
looking steadily at the Sanhedrim, said, Men and brothers, I have
lived before God in all good conscience to this day. <sup class=
"v">23:2</sup>And the chief priest Ananias commanded those standing
by to strike him on the mouth. <sup class="v">23:3</sup>Then Paul
said to him, God is about to strike you, whitewashed wall; and do
you sit to judge me according to the law, and command me to be
struck contrary to the law? <sup class="v">23:4</sup>And those
standing by said, Do you revile God's chief priest? <sup class=
"v">23:5</sup>And Paul said, I knew not brothers that he was a
chief priest; for it is written, You shall not speak evil of the
ruler of your people.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">23:6</sup>And Paul knowing that
one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, cried in the
Sanhedrim, Men and brothers, I am a Pharisee and the son of
Pharisees; for the hope and resurrection of the dead am I under
trial. <sup class="v">23:7</sup>And having said this, there was a
dissension between the Pharisees and Sadducees, and the multitude
were divided. <sup class="v">23:8</sup>For the Sadducees say that
there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit, but the
Pharisees confess both. <sup class="v">23:9</sup>And there was a
great cry, and the scribes of the party of the Pharisees rising up
contended, saying, We find no evil in this man; but [what] if a
spirit or an angel has spoken to him? <sup class="v">23:10</sup>And
there being a great dissension, the chiliarch, fearing that Paul
would be torn in pieces by them, commanded the troops to come down
and take him by force from the midst of them, and conduct him to
the fortress.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">23:11</sup>And on the following
night the Lord stood by him and said, Be of good courage, for as
you have testified of me at Jerusalem, so you must also testify at
Rome. <sup class="v">23:12</sup>And when it was day, the Jews
formed a conspiracy and bound themselves by an oath, saying that
they would not eat nor drink till they had killed Paul. <sup class=
"v">23:13</sup>And there were more than forty who took this oath,
<sup class="v">23:14</sup>who came to the chief priests and elders
and said, We have bound ourselves under a curse to taste nothing
till we kill Paul. <sup class="v">23:15</sup>Now, therefore, speak
to the chiliarch, with the Sanhedrim, to bring him down to you
tomorrow, as if you were about to investigate his case more
accurately, and we, before he comes nigh, are ready to kill
him.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">23:16</sup>But a son of Paul's
sister hearing of this lying in wait, went and entering into the
fortress told Paul. <sup class="v">23:17</sup>And Paul calling one
of the centurions, said, Lead this young man to the chiliarch, for
he has something to tell him. <sup class="v">23:18</sup>He
therefore took him and led him to the chiliarch, and said, Paul the
prisoner called me and asked me to lead this young man to you, who
has something to tell you. <sup class="v">23:19</sup>And the
chiliarch taking him by the hand and leading him aside, inquired,
What is it that you have to tell me? <sup class="v">23:20</sup>And
he said, The Jews have entered into a compact to ask you to bring
down Paul to the Sanhedrim to-morrow, as if about to learn more
accurately of something concerning him. <sup class=
"v">23:21</sup>But do not therefore be persuaded by them; for more
than forty men of them lie in wait, who have taken an oath not to
eat nor drink till they have killed him, and now they are ready,
awaiting an answer from you. <sup class="v">23:22</sup>Then the
chiliarch dismissed the young man, charging him, Tell no one that
you have informed me of these things.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">23:23</sup>And calling two of the
centurions he said, Prepare two hundred soldiers to go to
C&aelig;sarea, and seventy horsemen and two hundred light armed
troops, after the third hour of the night. <sup class=
"v">23:24</sup>And provide animals to put Paul on, and take him
safely to Felix the procurator. <sup class="v">23:25</sup>And he
wrote a letter having this form; <sup class="v">23:26</sup>Claudius
Lysias to the most excellent procurator Felix, greeting.
<sup class="v">23:27</sup>I went with the soldiery and rescued this
man, when he was seized by the Jews, and about to be killed by
them, having learned that he is a Roman; <sup class=
"v">23:28</sup>and wishing to know the cause for which they accuse
him, I took him down to their Sanhedrim, <sup class=
"v">23:29</sup>and found him criminated in respect to questions of
their law, but charged with nothing worthy of death or bonds.
<sup class="v">23:30</sup>Being informed that a conspiracy was
about to be formed against the man, I immediately sent to you,
commanding also his accusers to speak before you.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">23:31</sup>The soldiers therefore
took Paul as they were commanded and brought him by night to
Antipatris, <sup class="v">23:32</sup>and the next day leaving the
horsemen to go with him, they returned to the fortress. <sup class=
"v">23:33</sup>And when they came to C&aelig;sarea, and had
delivered the letter to the procurator, they also presented Paul to
him. <sup class="v">23:34</sup>And having read, he asked of what
province he was; and learning that he was of Cilicia, <sup class=
"v">23:35</sup>I will hear you, he said, when your accusers have
come; and he commanded him to be kept in the Pr&aelig;torium of
Herod.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>
<h3>PAUL'S TRIAL BEFORE FELIX THE PROCURATOR.&mdash;A.D. 59,
60.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">24:1</sup>AND after five days the
chief priest Ananias, with the elders, and a certain orator,
Tertullus, went down and gave information to the procurator against
Paul. <sup class="v">24:2</sup>And he being called, Tertullus began
to accuse him, saying, Having obtained great peace by you, and
things being happily arranged for this nation by your oversight in
all things and in all places <sup class="v">24:3</sup>we accept
[it] most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness. <sup class=
"v">24:4</sup>But that I may not further weary you, I beg you to
hear us briefly, with your clemency. <sup class="v">24:5</sup>For
finding this man a pestilence and a mover of sedition among all the
Jews throughout the world, and a chief of the sect of the
Nazoraeans, <sup class="v">24:6</sup>who also endeavored to profane
the temple, whom we also took, <sup class="v">24:8</sup>from whom
you will be able to learn by examination of all these things of
which we accuse him. <sup class="v">24:9</sup>And the Jews also
assented, saying, These things are so.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">24:10</sup>And the procurator
making a sign to him to speak, Paul answered, Knowing that you have
been for many years a judge of this nation, I shall defend myself
cheerfully, <sup class="v">24:11</sup>you being able to know that
it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship at
Jerusalem. <sup class="v">24:12</sup>And they did not find me in
the temple disputing with any one, or making a disturbance of the
multitude, neither in the synagogues nor in the city; <sup class=
"v">24:13</sup>neither can they prove the things of which they now
accuse me.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">24:14</sup>But this I confess to
you, that in the way which they call a heresy, so worship I the God
of my fathers; believing all things written in the law and the
prophets, <sup class="v">24:15</sup>having a hope in God which they
also hold, that there will be a resurrection both of the righteous
and wicked. <sup class="v">24:16</sup>And in this also I endeavor
always to have a conscience without offense towards God and
man.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">24:17</sup>But after many years I
came to bring charities and offerings to my nation, <sup class=
"v">24:18</sup>in which certain Jews from Asia found me purified in
the temple, not with a multitude, nor with a tumult, <sup class=
"v">24:19</sup>who ought to be present and accuse me before you, if
they have any thing against me. <sup class="v">24:20</sup>Or let
them say whether they found any unrighteousness in me when I stood
before the Sanhedrim, <sup class="v">24:21</sup>except in this one
statement which I made, as I stood among them, that I am under
trial by you to-day concerning the resurrection of the dead.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">24:22</sup>But Felix put them
off, saying, Having learned more accurately of this way, when
Lysias the chiliarch comes down I will decide concerning your
matters, <sup class="v">24:23</sup>and he commanded the centurion
that Paul should be kept, and be freed from bonds, and that he
should forbid none of his friends to serve him.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">24:24</sup>And after some days
Felix coming with Drusilla his wife, who was a Jewess, sent for
Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ. <sup class=
"v">24:25</sup>And as he discoursed of righteousness, and
temperance, and the judgment about to come, Felix being terrified
answered, Go for the present; but when I have time I will call you.
<sup class="v">24:26</sup>At the same time also he hoped that money
would be given him by Paul; and on this account sent for him the
oftener, and conversed with him. <sup class="v">24:27</sup>But
after two years had passed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus;
and wishing to gratify the Jews, Felix left Paul bound.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>
<h3>PAUL'S TRIAL BEFORE FESTUS, HIS APPEAL TO C&AElig;SAR, AND HIS
SUBSEQUENT DEFENSE BEFORE AGRIPPA.&mdash;A.D. 61.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">25:1</sup>FESTUS therefore coming
into the province, after three days went up from C&aelig;sarea to
Jerusalem. <sup class="v">25:2</sup>And the chief priests and the
first men of the Jews informed him against Paul, and besought him,
<sup class="v">25:3</sup>asking favor against him, that he would
send for him to Jerusalem, having provided an ambuscade to kill him
on the way. <sup class="v">25:4</sup>Then Festus answered that Paul
should be kept at C&aelig;sarea, and that he would go down there
shortly; <sup class="v">25:5</sup>and then, he said, the principal
men among you may go down with me; if there is any thing against
this man they may prosecute him. <sup class="v">25:6</sup>And
staying with them not more than eight or ten days, he went down to
C&aelig;sarea, and on the next day, sitting on the tribunal,
commanded Paul to be brought.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">25:7</sup>And when he had come,
the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him,
bringing many and weighty accusations which they could not prove,
<sup class="v">25:8</sup>while Paul maintained in his defense,
Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor
against C&aelig;sar, have I done any wrong.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">25:9</sup>But Festus wishing to
gratify the Jews, answered Paul and said, Are you willing to go up
to Jerusalem, and there be tried by me for these things?
<sup class="v">25:10</sup>And Paul said, I stand at the tribunal of
C&aelig;sar, where I ought to be tried. I have not injured the
Jews, as you also know very well. <sup class="v">25:11</sup>If
indeed I have done wrong or committed any thing worthy of death, I
refuse not to die; but if those things of which they accuse me are
nothing, no man may give me up to them; I appeal to C&aelig;sar.
<sup class="v">25:12</sup>Then Festus having conferred with the
council answered, You have appealed to C&aelig;sar; to C&aelig;sar
you shall go.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">25:13</sup>But after some days
king Agrippa and Bernice came down to C&aelig;sarea to salute
Festus. <sup class="v">25:14</sup>And when they had staid there
many days, Festus proposed the case of Paul to the king, saying,
There is a certain man left a prisoner by Felix, <sup class=
"v">25:15</sup>concerning whom when I was at Jerusalem the chief
priests and elders of the Jews gave me information, asking judgment
against him; <sup class="v">25:16</sup>to whom I answered, It is
not the custom of the Romans to give up any man before the accused
has the accusers face to face, and is allowed an opportunity to
defend himself against the accusation.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">25:17</sup>When therefore, they
came here, making no delay, the next day I sat on the tribunal, and
ordered the man to be brought; <sup class="v">25:18</sup>concerning
whom his accusers standing up brought no charge of such things as I
supposed, <sup class="v">25:19</sup>but had certain questions with
him concerning their religion, and concerning one Jesus that was
dead, who Paul said was alive. <sup class="v">25:20</sup>Being in
doubt on the question concerning these things, I asked if he was
willing to go to Jerusalem and be tried by me there on these
charges. <sup class="v">25:21</sup>But Paul appealing, to be kept
for the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I
could send him to C&aelig;sar. <sup class="v">25:22</sup>And
Agrippa [said] to Festus, I should like to hear the man also
myself. And he said, To-morrow you shall hear him.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">25:23</sup>On the next day,
therefore, Agrippa and Bernice coming with great pomp, and entering
into the place of hearing with chiliarchs and men of distinction in
the city, at the command of Festus Paul was brought. <sup class=
"v">25:24</sup>And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all the men
present with us, you see this man, of whom all the multitude of the
Jews besought me, both at Jerusalem and here, crying out that he
ought no longer to live. <sup class="v">25:25</sup>But finding that
he had done nothing deserving death, and he having appealed to
Augustus, I have determined to send him. <sup class=
"v">25:26</sup>But I have nothing certain to write to the sovereign
concerning him, wherefore I have brought him before you, and
especially before you, King Agrippa, that on examination I may have
something to write; <sup class="v">25:27</sup>for it seems to me
unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not to signify the charges
against him.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">26:1</sup>And Agrippa said to
Paul, You are permitted to speak for yourself. Then Paul stretched
out his hand and made his defense. <sup class="v">26:2</sup>I think
myself happy, King Agrippa, in being allowed to make my defense
before you to-day in respect to all things of which I am accused by
the Jews, <sup class="v">26:3</sup>especially as you are acquainted
with all the customs and questions of the Jews; wherefore, I beg
you to hear me patiently. <sup class="v">26:4</sup>My mode of life
from my childhood, the early part of it being with my nation at
Jerusalem, know all the Jews, <sup class="v">26:5</sup>who knew me
from the first, if they would testify, that according to the
strictest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee. <sup class=
"v">26:6</sup>And now I stand on trial for the hope of the promise
made by God to our fathers, <sup class="v">26:7</sup>which our
twelve tribes, serving God continually, day and night, hope to
attain; of this hope, King Agrippa, I am accused by the Jews.
<sup class="v">26:8</sup>Why is it judged by you incredible that
God raises the dead? <sup class="v">26:9</sup>I indeed thought with
myself that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus
the Nazoraean, <sup class="v">26:10</sup>which I also did at
Jerusalem, and many of the saints I shut up in prison, having
received authority from the chief priests, and when they were
killed I gave my vote against them. <sup class="v">26:11</sup>And
punishing them often in all the synagogues, I compelled them to
blaspheme, and being exceedingly mad against them, I pursued them
even to cities abroad.</p>
<p class="pin">8 <sup class="v">26:12</sup>In which
[persecutions] also, going to Damascus with authority, and a
commission from the chief priests, <sup class="v">26:13</sup>at
midday I saw in the way O king, a light from heaven shining around
me and those going with me, exceeding the brightness of the sun;
<sup class="v">26:14</sup>and when we had all fallen on the earth,
I heard a voice speaking to me and saying in the Hebrew language,
Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? it is hard for you to kick
against the goads. <sup class="v">26:15</sup>And I said, Who are
you, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom you persecute.
<sup class="v">26:16</sup>But rise and stand on your feet; for I
have appeared to you for this purpose, to make you a minister and
witness both of what you have seen and [of visions ] in which I
will appear to you, <sup class="v">26:17</sup>delivering you from
the people, and the gentiles, to whom I send you <sup class=
"v">26:18</sup>to open their eyes, to turn them from darkness to
light, and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive
forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among the sanctified by
faith in me. <sup class="v">26:19</sup>Whence, King Agrippa, I was
not disobedient to the heavenly vision, <sup class=
"v">26:20</sup>but preached first to those at Damascus and
Jerusalem, and in all the country of Judea, and to the gentiles,
that they should change their minds and turn to God, performing
works worthy of a change of mind.</p>
<p class="pin">9 <sup class="v">26:21</sup>On this account the
Jews seized me in the temple and endeavored to kill me. <sup class=
"v">26:22</sup>Having obtained therefore help from God, I have
continued to this day, testifying to small and great, saying
nothing but what the prophets and Moses said should take place;
<sup class="v">26:23</sup>that the Christ should suffer, and that
he first from the resurrection of the dead should proclaim light
both to the people and the nations.</p>
<p class="pin">10 <sup class="v">26:24</sup>And when Paul had
said these words, Festus said with a loud voice, You are mad, Paul;
much learning has driven you to madness. <sup class=
"v">26:25</sup>But he said, I am not mad, most excellent Festus,
but utter words of truth and sobriety. <sup class=
"v">26:26</sup>For the king knows of these things, before whom I
speak freely; for I am persuaded that none of these things have
escaped his notice; for this was not done in a corner. <sup class=
"v">26:27</sup>King Agrippa, believe you the prophets? I know that
you believe. <sup class="v">26:28</sup>And Agrippa said to Paul,
You almost persuade me to be a Christian. <sup class=
"v">26:29</sup>And Paul said, I would to God that not only you but
also all who hear me this day were both almost and altogether such
as I am, except these bonds. <sup class="v">26:30</sup>And the king
arose, and the procurator, and Bernice, and those who sat with
them, <sup class="v">26:31</sup>and departing they conversed with
each other, saying, This man has done nothing deserving death or
bonds. <sup class="v">26:32</sup>And Agrippa said to Festus, If he
had not appealed to C&aelig;sar, this man might be released.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>
<h3>PAUL'S VOYAGE TO ROME.&mdash;A.D. 61, 62.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">27:1</sup>AND when it was
determined that we should sail to Italy, they delivered Paul and
certain other prisoners to a centurion by the name of Julius, of
the cohort of Augustus. <sup class="v">27:2</sup>And going on board
of a ship of Adramyttium, which was about to sail to places in
Asia, we set sail, Aristarchus a Macedonian of Thessalonica being
with us; <sup class="v">27:3</sup>and on the next day we came to
Sidon, and Julius treating Paul with humanity allowed him to go to
his friends, and receive attention.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">27:4</sup>Proceeding thence we
sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary, <sup class=
"v">27:5</sup>and sailing through the sea by Cilicia and Pamphylia
we came to Myra in Lycia; <sup class="v">27:6</sup>and the
centurion finding there an Alexandrian ship sailing to Italy, put
us into it. <sup class="v">27:7</sup>And sailing slowly in those
days, and scarcely being by Cnidus, the wind not permitting us [to
proceed in a direct course] we sailed under Crete, by Salmone,
<sup class="v">27:8</sup>and sailing by it with difficulty, we came
to a place called Fair Havens, near which is the city Lasea.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">27:9</sup>But some time being
spent and navigation not being safe, because the fast had already
passed by, Paul advised, <sup class="v">27:10</sup>saying to them,
Men, I see that the voyage will be with injury and much loss, not
only of the cargo and ship, but also of our lives. <sup class=
"v">27:11</sup>But the centurion believed the master and owner
rather than the words spoken by Paul. <sup class="v">27:12</sup>And
the harbor being inconvenient to winter in, the greater part
advised to depart thence, and, if they were able, to come to
Phenice to winter, a harbor of Crete, which opens to the South and
Southwest.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">27:13</sup>And the South wind
blowing gently, supposing that they had attained their purpose,
setting sail they proceeded along the coast of Crete. <sup class=
"v">27:14</sup>But not long after a tempestuous wind, called
Euroclydon, rushed against it, <sup class="v">27:15</sup>and the
ship being caught and not being able to bear up against the wind,
we gave up, and were borne along. <sup class="v">27:16</sup>And
running a little under the island called Clauda, we with difficulty
became masters of the boat, <sup class="v">27:17</sup>and taking it
out they used helps, under-girding the ship; and fearing lest they
should fall on the shoal, letting down the mast they were driven in
that condition. <sup class="v">27:18</sup>And we being exceedingly
pressed with the storm, on the next day they cast the cargo
overboard, <sup class="v">27:19</sup>and on the third day with our
own hands we cast overboard the furniture of the ship. <sup class=
"v">27:20</sup>And neither sun nor stars appearing for many days,
and no slight storm being upon us, at last all hope that we should
be saved was taken away.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">27:21</sup>Then there having been
long abstinence from food, Paul stood up in the midst of them and
said, You ought, men, taking my advice, not to have sailed from
Crete, and to have saved this injury and loss. <sup class=
"v">27:22</sup>And now I advise you to be of good courage; for
there shall be no loss of a life of you, but only of the ship.
<sup class="v">27:23</sup>For an angel of the God whose I am, and
whom I serve, came to me this night <sup class="v">27:24</sup>and
said, Fear not, Paul; you must stand before C&aelig;sar, and
behold, God has given you all that sail with you. <sup class=
"v">27:25</sup>Wherefore, men, be of good courage; for I believe
God, that it will be as he has told me; <sup class=
"v">27:26</sup>but we must be cast on a certain island.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">27:27</sup>And on the fourteenth
night, when we were borne along in the Adriatic, at about midnight
the sailors suspected that some land was approaching them.
<sup class="v">27:28</sup>And sounding they found twenty fathoms,
and going a little distance and sounding again they found fifteen
fathoms; <sup class="v">27:29</sup>and fearing lest we should fall
on rough places, casting out four anchors from the stern, they
prayed for day. <sup class="v">27:30</sup>And the sailors seeking
to escape from the ship, and letting down the boat into the sea,
with the pretence that they were about to put out anchors from the
fore part of the ship, <sup class="v">27:31</sup>Paul said to the
centurion and soldiers, Unless these continue in the ship you
cannot be saved. <sup class="v">27:32</sup>Then the soldiers cut
the ropes of the boat and let it fall off.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">27:33</sup>And when day was about
to appear, Paul exhorted all to take food, saying, It is the
fourteenth day to-day that you have watched and continued without
food, taking nothing. <sup class="v">27:34</sup>Wherefore I exhort
you to partake of food; for this is necessary to your safety, for
there shall not a hair perish from the head of any one of you.
<sup class="v">27:35</sup>And having said these things, and taken
bread, he thanked God before all, and having broken began to eat.
<sup class="v">27:36</sup>And all being in good spirits they also
partook of food; <sup class="v">27:37</sup>and all the souls in the
ship were two hundred and seventy-six. <sup class=
"v">27:38</sup>And being satisfied with food they lightened the
ship, casting the wheat into the sea.</p>
<p class="pin">8 <sup class="v">27:39</sup>And when it was day
they did not know the land, but they perceived a bay having a
shore, on which they wished if possible to thrust the ship.
<sup class="v">27:40</sup>And taking up the anchors, they committed
[the ship] to the sea, loosening at the same time the fastenings of
the rudder and raising the top sail to the wind, they bore down
towards the shore. <sup class="v">27:41</sup>And falling on a place
with a sea on both sides, they run the ship aground. And the bow
being firmly fixed, remained immoveable; and the stern was broken
by violence.</p>
<p class="pin">9 <sup class="v">27:42</sup>And the design of the
soldiers was to kill the prisoners, that none might escape by
swimming; <sup class="v">27:43</sup>but the centurion wishing to
save Paul, prohibited them from this design, and commanded those
able to swim to cast themselves into the water first, and go to the
land; <sup class="v">27:44</sup>and the rest, some on boards, and
some on parts of the ship; and in this way all were brought safely
to land.</p>
<p class="pin">10 <sup class="v">28:1</sup>And when they were
saved, they learned that the island was called Melita. <sup class=
"v">28:2</sup>And the barbarians showed us no ordinary humanity;
for kindling a fire they received us all, on account of the rain
which was falling, and the cold. <sup class="v">28:3</sup>And Paul
having collected a bundle of sticks and put them on the fire, a
viper coming out from the heat fastened on his hand. <sup class=
"v">28:4</sup>And when the barbarians saw the creature hanging from
his hand, they said one to another, This man is undoubtedly a
murderer, whom though saved from the sea justice has not permitted
to live. <sup class="v">28:5</sup>Then shaking off the creature
into the fire he suffered no harm; <sup class="v">28:6</sup>but
they expected that he would swell up, or suddenly fall down dead.
And waiting a long time, and seeing nothing extraordinary happen to
him, they thought differently, and said, He is a god.</p>
<p class="pin">11 <sup class="v">28:7</sup>Near that place were
the lands of the first man in the island, whose name was Poplius,
who received and entertained us kindly three days. <sup class=
"v">28:8</sup>And the father of Poplius lay sick with a fever and
dysentery, and Paul came to him, and prayed, and put his hands on
him, and cured him. <sup class="v">28:9</sup>And this being done,
the rest also who had sicknesses in the island came and were cured,
<sup class="v">28:10</sup>and they bestowed on us many rewards, and
when we left supplied us with things that we needed.</p>
<p class="pin">12 <sup class="v">28:11</sup>And after three
months we sailed away in an Alexandrian vessel, that had wintered
in the island, with the sign of Castor and Pollux. <sup class=
"v">28:12</sup>And coming to Syracuse we remained there three days;
<sup class="v">28:13</sup>and proceeding thence we came to Rhegium,
and after one day, a south wind blowing, we came the second day to
Puteoli, <sup class="v">28:14</sup>where finding brothers we were
invited to remain with them seven days; and thus we came to Rome.
<sup class="v">28:15</sup>And thence, the brothers hearing of us
came out to meet us even to the Forum of Appius, and the Three
Taverns [fifty-one miles]; and when Paul saw them, thanking God he
took courage.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>
<h3>PAUL AT ROME.&mdash;A.D. 62, 64.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">28:16</sup>AND when we came to
Rome the centurion committed the prisoners to the prefect of the
camp, and Paul was allowed to remain by himself, with a soldier to
guard him. <sup class="v">28:17</sup>And after three days he called
the chief men of the Jews together; and when they had convened,
said to them, Men and brothers, having done nothing contrary to the
people or to the customs of the fathers, I was delivered up from
Jerusalem a prisoner into the hands of the Romans, <sup class=
"v">28:18</sup>who on trial wished to release me, because they
found no cause of death in me; <sup class="v">28:19</sup>but the
Jews opposing it I was compelled to appeal to C&aelig;sar; not that
I have any thing of which to accuse my nation. <sup class=
"v">28:20</sup>For this reason, therefore, I have called you to see
and converse with you, because I am loaded with this chain on
account of the hope of Israel.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">28:21</sup>And they said to him,
We have neither received letters concerning you from Judea, nor has
any one of the brothers come and reported or told any evil of you.
<sup class="v">28:22</sup>But we would like to hear from you what
you think, for it is known to us concerning this sect, that it is
everywhere spoken against.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">28:23</sup>And appointing him a
day they came in great numbers to his lodging, to whom he set forth
and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus
both from the law of Moses and the prophets, from morning till
evening. <sup class="v">28:24</sup>And some believed the things
which were spoken, and others believed not; <sup class=
"v">28:25</sup>and disagreeing among themselves they were dismissed
by Paul, saying one word; Well did the Holy Spirit speak by Isaiah
the prophet to our fathers, <sup class="v">28:26</sup>saying, Go to
this people and say, Hearing you shall hear and not understand, and
seeing you shall see and not perceive; <sup class=
"v">28:27</sup>for the heart of this people has become hard, and
they hear imperfectly with their ears, and they have shut their
eyes, lest at any time they should see with their eyes, and hear
with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and turn, and I
should cure them. <sup class="v">28:28</sup>Be it known to you,
therefore, that the salvation of God is sent to the gentiles, and
they will hear it.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">28:30</sup>But Paul continued two
entire years in his hired house, and received all who came to him,
<sup class="v">28:31</sup>preaching the kingdom of God, and
teaching the doctrines concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all
boldness and without hindrance.</p>

<h3>CORINTH, A.D. 53. (ACTS 16, 3.)</h3>
<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>
<h3>THE INTRODUCTION OF THE GOSPEL TO THE THESSALONIANS, TIMOTHY'S
VISIT AND REPORT, ETC.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">1:1</sup>PAUL and Sylvanus
[Silas] and Timothy to the church of the Thessalonians in God the
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Grace be to you and peace.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">1:2</sup>We thank God always for
you all, making mention of you in our prayers, <sup class=
"v">1:3</sup>remembering without ceasing your work of faith and
labor of love and patience of the hope of our Lord Jesus Christ
before God even our Father, <sup class="v">1:4</sup>knowing,
brothers beloved by God, your election, <sup class=
"v">1:5</sup>that our gospel came not to you in word only, but with
power and with the Holy Spirit and with full assurance, as you know
what we were among you for your sakes.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">1:6</sup>And you became followers
of us and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction
with the joy of the Holy Spirit, <sup class="v">1:7</sup>so that
you became an example to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia.
<sup class="v">1:8</sup>For from you the word of the Lord was
proclaimed not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but your faith with
respect to God went into every place, so that we had no need to say
any thing; <sup class="v">1:9</sup>for they declare of us what
introduction we had to you, and how you turned from idols to God,
to serve the living and true God, <sup class="v">1:10</sup>and to
wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, Jesus,
who delivers us from the wrath to come.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">2:1</sup>For you know, brothers,
our introduction to you that it was not in vain, <sup class=
"v">2:2</sup>but having suffered before, and been injuriously
treated, as you know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak
to you the gospel of God with much contention. <sup class=
"v">2:3</sup>For our exhortation was not of error, nor of impurity,
nor with deceit, <sup class="v">2:4</sup>but as we were judged
worthy by God to be intrusted with the gospel so we speak, not as
pleasing men, but God who tries our hearts. <sup class=
"v">2:5</sup>For we used at no time a word of flattery, as you
know, nor a pretext for covetousness, God is witness, <sup class=
"v">2:6</sup>neither did we seek glory of men, either of you or of
others, when we might have been burdensome as apostles of Christ;
<sup class="v">2:7</sup>but we were gentle among you, as a nurse
would cherish her own children; <sup class="v">2:8</sup>so being
greatly desirous of you, we were well pleased to impart to you not
only the gospel of God, but our own souls, because you were dear to
us. <sup class="v">2:9</sup>For you remember, brothers, our labor
and weariness; that working night and day not to be burdensome to
any one of you, we preached to you the gospel of God. <sup class=
"v">2:10</sup>You are witnesses, and God, how piously, and
righteously, and blamelessly we were with you that believe,
<sup class="v">2:11</sup>as you know how we exhorted and comforted
you, as a father each one of his own children, <sup class=
"v">2:12</sup>and charged you to walk worthily of God who calls you
into his kingdom and glory.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">2:13</sup>For this cause also we
thank God without ceasing, that receiving the word of God heard
from us, you received not a word of men, but, as it is in truth, a
word of God, who also works in you that believe. <sup class=
"v">2:14</sup>For you, brothers, became followers of the churches
of God in Christ Jesus which were in Judea, for you also suffered
the same things from your countrymen, which they did from the Jews
<sup class="v">2:15</sup>who also killed the Lord Jesus and the
prophets, and persecuted us, and who please not God and are hostile
to all men, <sup class="v">2:16</sup>forbidding us to speak to the
gentiles that they may be saved, that they may fill up their sins
always; and the wrath has come on them to the utmost.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">2:17</sup>But we, brothers, being
deprived of you for a short time in presence, not in heart, used
greater diligence to see your face, with much desire. <sup class=
"v">2:18</sup>For which reason we wished to come to you; I Paul
indeed once and again, and Satan hindered us. <sup class=
"v">2:19</sup>For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing?
Is it not even you before our Lord Jesus at his coming? <sup class=
"v">2:20</sup>For you are our glory and joy.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">3:1</sup>When therefore we could
no longer refrain, we thought it best to be left alone at Athens,
<sup class="v">3:2</sup>and sent Timothy, our brother and God's
co-laborer in the gospel of Christ, to confirm you and to exhort
you in behalf of your faith, <sup class="v">3:3</sup>that no one
should be moved by these afflictions. For you know that we are
appointed for this; <sup class="v">3:4</sup>for indeed when we came
to you, we told you before that we were about to suffer affliction,
as it also happened, and you know. <sup class="v">3:5</sup>For this
reason, being no longer able to forbear, I sent to know your faith,
lest in some way the tempter should have tempted you, and our labor
be in vain.</p>
<p class="pin">8 <sup class="v">3:6</sup>But now Timothy having
come to us from you and told us the good news of your faith and
love, and that you have a good remembrance of us always, desiring
to see us, as we also you, <sup class="v">3:7</sup>therefore we
were comforted, brothers, on your account in all our affliction and
distress by your faith, <sup class="v">3:8</sup>for now we live, if
you stand firm in the Lord. <sup class="v">3:9</sup>For what
thanksgiving can we render to God for you for all the joy with
which we rejoice on your account before our God, <sup class=
"v">3:10</sup>desiring exceedingly, night and day, to see your
face, and to perfect what is lacking of your faith?</p>
<p class="pin">9 <sup class="v">3:11</sup>And may God himself,
even our Father, and our Lord Jesus direct our way to you;
<sup class="v">3:12</sup>and the Lord cause you to be full and
abound with love one to another and to all men, as we also to you,
<sup class="v">3:13</sup>to confirm your hearts without blame in
holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord
Jesus with all his saints.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<h3>CHASTITY, BROTHERLY LOVE, THE STATE OF THE DEAD, THE COMING OF
CHRIST, ETC.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">4:1</sup>FINALLY, therefore,
brothers, we beseech and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, as you have
received from us how you ought to walk and please God, that you
abound still more. <sup class="v">4:2</sup>For you know what
commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus. <sup class=
"v">4:3</sup>For this is the will of God, your purity, that you
should abstain from fornication, <sup class="v">4:4</sup>that each
one should know how to have his wife in purity and honor,
<sup class="v">4:5</sup>not with inordinate desires like the
gentiles who know not God, <sup class="v">4:6</sup>that he should
not go beyond and defraud his brother in the matter, because the
Lord is a punisher of all these, as we also told you before and
fully testified. <sup class="v">4:7</sup>For God has not called us
to impurity, but to purity. <sup class="v">4:8</sup>He therefore
that despises, despises not man, but God, who also gives us his
Holy Spirit.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">4:9</sup>But concerning brotherly
love, you have no need that I should write to you; for you are
taught by God to love one another; <sup class="v">4:10</sup>for you
also do the same to all the brothers in all Macedonia. But we
exhort you, brothers, to abound still more, <sup class=
"v">4:11</sup>and strive to be quiet and pursue your own business,
and work with your hands, as we charged you, <sup class=
"v">4:12</sup>that you may walk becomingly towards those without
and have need of nothing.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">4:13</sup>And we wish you not to
be ignorant, brothers, concerning those that have fallen asleep,
that you may not grieve as others who have no hope. <sup class=
"v">4:14</sup>For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, so
also will God bring with him those that have fallen asleep on
account of Jesus. <sup class="v">4:15</sup>For we tell you this by
the word of the Lord, that we who live and remain till the coming
of the Lord, shall not anticipate those that have fallen asleep,
<sup class="v">4:16</sup>for the Lord himself will descend from
heaven with a shout, with the voice of an archangel, and with the
trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first,
<sup class="v">4:17</sup>then we the living who remain shall be
caught up together with them in clouds, to meet the Lord in the
air; and so we shall be always with the Lord. <sup class=
"v">4:18</sup>Comfort one another, therefore, with these words.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">5:1</sup>But concerning the times
and season, brothers, you have no need that I should write to you;
<sup class="v">5:2</sup>for you yourselves know perfectly that the
day of the Lord comes like a thief in the night. <sup class=
"v">5:3</sup>When they say, Peace and safety, then sudden
destruction comes, like pain upon a woman with child, and they
shall not escape. <sup class="v">5:4</sup>But you, brothers, are
not in darkness, that the day should come upon you like a thief;
<sup class="v">5:5</sup>for you are all children of light, and
children of day; we are not of night nor of darkness.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">5:6</sup>Therefore let us not
sleep as others, but let us watch and be sober. <sup class=
"v">5:7</sup>For they that sleep sleep in the night, and they that
are drunk drink in the night; <sup class="v">5:8</sup>but let us
who are of day be sober, putting on a cuirass of faith and love,
and for a helmet the hope of salvation, <sup class="v">5:9</sup>for
God has not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our
Lord Jesus Christ, <sup class="v">5:10</sup>who died for us, that,
whether we wake or sleep, we may live together with him.
<sup class="v">5:11</sup>Wherefore exhort one another, and edify
one another, as you also do.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">5:12</sup>And we beseech you,
brothers, to know those who labor among you, and preside over you
in the Lord and admonish you, <sup class="v">5:13</sup>and to
esteem them very highly in love on account of their work. Be at
peace among yourselves. <sup class="v">5:14</sup>And we exhort you,
brothers, admonish the disorderly, comfort the dispirited, assist
the sick, be of long suffering towards all men. <sup class=
"v">5:15</sup>See that no one renders evil for evil, but always
pursue the good both one to another and to all.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">5:16</sup>Rejoice always;
<sup class="v">5:17</sup>pray without ceasing, <sup class=
"v">5:18</sup>give thanks on every occasion; for this is the will
of God in Christ Jesus to us. <sup class="v">5:19</sup>Quench not
the Spirit, <sup class="v">5:20</sup>despise not prophecies.
<sup class="v">5:21</sup>Prove all things, hold fast the good;
<sup class="v">5:22</sup>abstain from every form of evil.
<sup class="v">5:23</sup>And may the God of peace himself purify
you wholly, and your whole spirit, and soul, and body, be preserved
blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. <sup class=
"v">5:24</sup>Faithful is he that calls you, who will also
perform.</p>
<p class="pin">8 <sup class="v">5:25</sup>Brothers, pray for us.
<sup class="v">5:26</sup>Salute all the brothers with a holy kiss.
<sup class="v">5:27</sup>I charge you by the Lord that this epistle
be read to all the holy brothers. <sup class="v">5:28</sup>The
grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.</p>

<h3>CORINTH, A.D. 53. (ACTS, 16:3.)</h3>
<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>
<h3>PAUL'S LOVE AND PRAYERS FOR THE THESSALONIAN CHRISTIANS, THE
COMING OF CHRIST, ETC.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">1:1</sup>PAUL and Silvanus
[Silas] and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God our
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. <sup class="v">1:2</sup>Grace be
to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">1:3</sup>We ought to thank God
always for you, brothers, as is fit, because your faith increases
greatly, and the love of every one of you all one for another
abounds, <sup class="v">1:4</sup>so that we boast of you in the
churches of God, of your patience and faith, in all your
persecutions and the afflictions which you endure, <sup class=
"v">1:5</sup>a token of the righteous judgment of God that you
should be deemed worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you also
suffer, <sup class="v">1:6</sup>since it is just with God to repay
affliction to those who afflict you, <sup class="v">1:7</sup>and to
you who are afflicted rest with us at the revelation of the Lord
Jesus from heaven with his mighty angels <sup class="v">1:8</sup>in
a flame of fire, executing judgment on all that know not God and
obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus; <sup class="v">1:9</sup>who
shall suffer the punishment of eternal destruction from the
presence of the Lord and from the glory of his power, <sup class=
"v">1:10</sup>when he shall come to be glorified in his saints and
to be admired by all that believe in that day, for our testimony
was believed by you. <sup class="v">1:11</sup>For which also we
pray always for you, that our God will account you worthy of the
calling, and accomplish all the good pleasure of [his] goodness and
the work of faith with power; <sup class="v">1:12</sup>that the
name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and you in him,
according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">2:1</sup>And we beseech you,
brothers, in respect to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and
our being brought together to him, <sup class="v">2:2</sup>that you
be not soon shaken in mind, nor terrified, neither by a spirit, nor
by a discourse, nor by an epistle as from us, as though the day of
the Lord was at hand. <sup class="v">2:3</sup>Let no one deceive
you in any way, for [he shall not come] unless the apostacy comes
first, and the man of sin is revealed, the son of destruction,
<sup class="v">2:4</sup>who opposes and exalts himself above every
thing that is called a god or an object of worship, so that he sits
in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God. <sup class=
"v">2:5</sup>Do you not remember that when I was with you I told
you of these things? <sup class="v">2:6</sup>And now you know what
hinders him from being revealed in his time. <sup class=
"v">2:7</sup>For the mystery of wickedness already works, [God]
only restrains it just now, till it shall be out of the way;
<sup class="v">2:8</sup>and then shall the wicked one be revealed,
whom the Lord will consume with the breath of his mouth and destroy
with the brightness of his coming, <sup class="v">2:9</sup>whose
coming is according to the power of Satan, with all power and
miracles and false prodigies <sup class="v">2:10</sup>and with
every unrighteous deceit among those who are destroyed, because
they received not the love of the truth that they might be saved.
<sup class="v">2:11</sup>And therefore, God sends them a power of
delusion that they should believe a lie, <sup class=
"v">2:12</sup>that they all may be condemned who believe not the
truth but have pleasure in wickedness.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">2:13</sup>But we ought to thank
God always for you, brothers beloved by the Lord, because God from
the beginning chose you to salvation by purification of spirit, and
belief of the truth, <sup class="v">2:14</sup>to which he called
you by our gospel, to obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
<sup class="v">2:15</sup>Therefore, brothers, stand firm, and hold
the traditions which you have been taught, whether by word or by
our epistle; <sup class="v">2:16</sup>and our Lord Jesus Christ
himself, and our God and Father, who has loved us and given us
eternal consolation and a good hope by grace, <sup class=
"v">2:17</sup>comfort and confirm your hearts in every good work
and word.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">3:1</sup>Finally, brothers, pray
for us, that the word of the Lord may run and be glorified, as also
with you, <sup class="v">3:2</sup>and that we may be delivered from
unreasonable and wicked men; for all have not faith. <sup class=
"v">3:3</sup>But the Lord is faithful, who will confirm you, and
guard you from evil. <sup class="v">3:4</sup>And we trust in the
Lord with respect to you, that you both do and will do what we
direct. <sup class="v">3:5</sup>And may the Lord direct your hearts
in the love of God, and in the patience of Christ.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">3:6</sup>And we charge you,
brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to withdraw from
every brother who walks disorderly and not according to the
tradition which you received from us. <sup class="v">3:7</sup>For
you know yourselves how you ought to follow us, for we walked not
disorderly among you, <sup class="v">3:8</sup>neither did we eat
bread of any one for nought, but worked with labor and fatigue,
night and day, not to be burdensome to any of you; <sup class=
"v">3:9</sup>not that we have not a right [to a support], but that
we may make ourselves an example for you to follow us. <sup class=
"v">3:10</sup>For when we were with you, we gave you this charge,
that if any one will not work, neither let him eat. <sup class=
"v">3:11</sup>For we hear that some go about among you in a
disorderly manner, not working, but being above work; <sup class=
"v">3:12</sup>we charge and exhort such, by our Lord Jesus Christ,
to work quietly, and eat their own bread. <sup class=
"v">3:13</sup>But, brothers, be not weary of well doing.
<sup class="v">3:14</sup>But if any one obeys not our word by this
epistle, mark that one, and have no association with him, that he
may be ashamed; <sup class="v">3:15</sup>and account him not as an
enemy, but admonish him as a brother. <sup class="v">3:16</sup>And
may the Lord of peace give you peace always in every way. The Lord
be with you all.</p>

 GALATIANS.</A></h1>
<h3>EPHESUS, A.D. 56. (ACTS, 17:3.)</h3>
<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>
<h3>PAUL'S ACCOUNT OF HIMSELF AND OF THE GOSPEL.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">1:1</sup>PAUL an apostle, not
from men nor by man but by Jesus Christ and God the Father who
raised him from the dead, <sup class="v">1:2</sup>and all the
brothers with me, to the churches of Galatia. <sup class=
"v">1:3</sup>Grace be to you and peace from God the Father and our
Lord Jesus Christ, <sup class="v">1:4</sup>who gave himself for our
sins, that he might deliver us from the present evil life according
to the will of God even our Father, <sup class="v">1:5</sup>to whom
be the glory forever and ever; amen.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">1:6</sup>I wonder that you have
so quickly turned away from him that called you in the grace of
Christ to another gospel, <sup class="v">1:7</sup>which is not
another; but there are some who disturb you and wish to subvert the
gospel of Christ. <sup class="v">1:8</sup>But if we or an angel
from heaven preach you another gospel contrary to what we have
preached you let him be accursed. <sup class="v">1:9</sup>As we
said before I now also say again, If any one preaches you a gospel
contrary to what you have received let him be accursed. <sup class=
"v">1:10</sup>For do I now obey man, or God? or do I seek to please
men? For if I yet pleased men, I could not have been a servant of
Christ.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">1:11</sup>For I certify you,
brothers, of the gospel preached by me, that it is not according to
man; <sup class="v">1:12</sup>for I neither received it from man
nor was I taught it, but by a revelation of Jesus Christ.
<sup class="v">1:13</sup>For you heard of my conduct formerly in
Judaism, that I greatly persecuted the church of God and destroyed
it; <sup class="v">1:14</sup>and was a proficient in Judaism beyond
many of my age among my people, being more exceedingly zealous for
the traditions of my fathers. <sup class="v">1:15</sup>But when God
who gave me being and called me by his grace, <sup class=
"v">1:16</sup>was pleased to reveal his Son in me, that I might
preach him among the gentiles, immediately I conferred not with
flesh and blood, <sup class="v">1:17</sup>neither did I go to
Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went to
Arabia and returned again to Damascus.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">1:18</sup>Then after three years
I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas, and staid with him fifteen
days; <sup class="v">1:19</sup>and I saw no other of the apostles
except James, the Lord's brother. <sup class="v">1:20</sup>And what
I write to you, behold, before God, I lie not.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">1:21</sup>Then I went into the
regions of Syria and Cilicia. <sup class="v">1:22</sup>But I was
unknown by face to the churches of Christ in Judea, <sup class=
"v">1:23</sup>only they heard that he who persecuted us formerly,
now preached the faith which he formerly destroyed; <sup class=
"v">1:24</sup>and they glorified God in me.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">2:1</sup>Then after fourteen
years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking also
Titus; <sup class="v">2:2</sup>and I went up by a revelation, and
proposed to them the gospel which I preach to the gentiles, but
privately to persons of distinction, lest I should run or had run
in vain. <sup class="v">2:3</sup>But Titus who was with me, and was
a Greek, was not compelled to be circumcised; <sup class=
"v">2:4</sup>but on account of false brothers brought in secretly
to act as spies against our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus,
to bring us into servitude, <sup class="v">2:5</sup>we did not
yield to them by subjection, for an hour, that the truth of the
gospel might continue with you. <sup class="v">2:6</sup>But from
those of distinction, whatever they were it makes no difference to
me,&mdash;God is partial to no man,&mdash;for those of distinction
added nothing to me, <sup class="v">2:7</sup>but on the contrary
seeing that I was intrusted with the gospel of the uncircumcision,
as Peter was of the circumcision,&mdash; <sup class=
"v">2:8</sup>for he that operated in Peter for the apostleship of
the circumcision, operated also in me for the gentiles,&mdash;
<sup class="v">2:9</sup>and knowing the grace given me, James and
Cephas and John, who were manifest pillars, gave to me and Barnabas
the right hand of fellowship that we should go to the gentiles and
they to the circumcision; <sup class="v">2:10</sup>only [they
wished] that we should remember the poor, which I was also forward
to do.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">2:11</sup>But when Peter came to
Antioch I opposed him to his face, because he was to blame.
<sup class="v">2:12</sup>For before some came from James he eat
with the gentiles; but when they came, he withdrew and separated
himself; fearing those of the circumcision; <sup class=
"v">2:13</sup>and the other Jews also dissembled with him, so that
Barnabas was carried away with their dissimulation. <sup class=
"v">2:14</sup>But when I saw that they walked not correctly,
according to the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter before all,
If you being a Jew live after the manner of the gentiles, and not
after the manner of the Jews, why do you compel the gentiles to
practise Judaism? <sup class="v">2:15</sup>For we Jews by race and
not sinners of the gentiles, <sup class="v">2:16</sup>knowing that
a man is not justified by works of the law but by the faith of
Jesus Christ, we also have believed in Jesus Christ, that we may be
justified by faith and not by works of the law, because by works of
the law shall no flesh be justified. <sup class="v">2:17</sup>But
if seeking to be justified by Christ we are found to be ourselves
also sinners, is Christ then a minister of sin? By no means.
<sup class="v">2:18</sup>For if I build up again what I have
destroyed, I make myself a transgressor. <sup class=
"v">2:19</sup>For by a law I have died to the law, that I may live
to God. <sup class="v">2:20</sup>I am crucified with Christ; and I
no longer live myself, but Christ lives in me; and the present life
which I live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God,
who loved me and gave himself for me. <sup class="v">2:21</sup>I do
not reject the grace of God; for if rightousness is through the
law, then Christ died for nothing.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<h3>RIGHTEOUSNESS EXPLAINED.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">3:1</sup>O FOOLISH Galatians, who
has fascinated you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ has been set
forth among you crucified? <sup class="v">3:2</sup>This only would
I learn of you. Did you receive the Spirit by works of the law, or
by a hearing of faith? <sup class="v">3:3</sup>Are you so foolish?
Having begun in the Spirit do you now end in the flesh? <sup class=
"v">3:4</sup>Have you suffered so much in vain? if indeed also it
is in vain. <sup class="v">3:5</sup>He then that imparts to you the
Spirit, and exercises miraculous powers among you, does he do it by
works of the law, or by the doctrine of faith? <sup class=
"v">3:6</sup>As Abraham believed God and it was accounted to him a
righteousness.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">3:7</sup>Know, therefore, that
those of faith, these are children of Abraham. <sup class=
"v">3:8</sup>And the Scripture foreseeing that God would justify
the nations by faith, promised before to Abraham, In you shall all
the nations be blessed. <sup class="v">3:9</sup>Those of faith,
therefore, are blessed with believing Abraham. <sup class=
"v">3:10</sup>For as many as are of works of the law are under a
curse; for it is written, Cursed is every one that continues not in
all things written in the book of the law to do them. <sup class=
"v">3:11</sup>And it is evident that no one is justified by the law
before God, because the just shall live by faith, <sup class=
"v">3:12</sup>but the law is not of faith, but he that does these
things shall live by them. <sup class="v">3:13</sup>Christ redeemed
us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us, for it
is written, Cursed is every one that hangs on a tree, <sup class=
"v">3:14</sup>that the blessing of Abraham may come on the nations,
in Christ Jesus, that we may receive the promise of the Spirit
through the faith.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">3:15</sup>Brothers, I speak
according to man. But no one abolishes a man's covenant when it is
established, or makes additions to it. <sup class="v">3:16</sup>The
promises were spoken to Abraham and his offspring. He said not, And
to offsprings, as of many, but as of one, And to your offspring,
which is Christ. <sup class="v">3:17</sup>And this I say; that the
law which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot abrogate
the covenant previously established by God, to make the promise of
no effect. <sup class="v">3:18</sup>For if the inheritance is by
the law, it is no longer by the promise. But God gave it to Abraham
by the promise. <sup class="v">3:19</sup>What then? The law was
added on account of transgressions, till the offspring should come
to which the promise was made, being appointed by angels by the
hand of a mediator. <sup class="v">3:20</sup>But there is no
mediator of one; but God is one.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">3:21</sup>Is the law then against
the promises of God? By no means. For if a law had been given, able
to give life, righteousness would really have been by the law;
<sup class="v">3:22</sup>but the Scripture has shut up all under
sin, that the promise of the faith of Jesus Christ may be given to
them that believe. <sup class="v">3:23</sup>But before the faith
came, we were kept shut up under the law for the faith to be
revealed. <sup class="v">3:24</sup>So that the law was our
schoolmaster to lead to Christ, that we might be justified by
faith; <sup class="v">3:25</sup>but the faith having come, we are
no longer under a schoolmaster. <sup class="v">3:26</sup>For you
are all children of God by the faith in Jesus Christ; <sup class=
"v">3:27</sup>for as many of you as are baptized in Christ, have
put on Christ. <sup class="v">3:28</sup>There is neither Jew nor
Greek, there is neither servant nor freeman, there is neither male
nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus. <sup class=
"v">3:29</sup>And if you are of Christ, then are you Abraham's
children and heirs according to the promise.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">4:1</sup>But I say, that as long
as the heir is a child, he differs not from a servant, though he is
lord of all, <sup class="v">4:2</sup>but is under tutors and
stewards till the time appointed by the father. <sup class=
"v">4:3</sup>So also we, when we were children, were in servitude
under the rudiments of the world; <sup class="v">4:4</sup>but when
the fullness of time came, God sent forth his Son, born of a woman,
born under the law, <sup class="v">4:5</sup>that he might redeem
those under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.
<sup class="v">4:6</sup>And because you are sons, God has sent
forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.
<sup class="v">4:7</sup>So that you are no longer a servant, but a
son; and if a son, also an heir of God.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">4:8</sup>But formerly, not
knowing God you served beings which are not really Gods;
<sup class="v">4:9</sup>but now knowing God, or rather being known
by God, how do you turn again to the weak and imperfect rudiments,
which you wish again to serve? <sup class="v">4:10</sup>Do you
observe days, and months, and times, and years? <sup class=
"v">4:11</sup>I am afraid of you, lest I have expended labor on you
in vain.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">4:12</sup>I beseech you,
brothers, be as I am, for I am as you [ought to be]. You did not
injure me; <sup class="v">4:13</sup>but you knew I preached the
gospel to you on my former [visit] in weakness of the flesh,
<sup class="v">4:14</sup>and my trial in my flesh you despised not
nor rejected, but received me as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus.
<sup class="v">4:15</sup>What then was your blessedness? For I bear
you witness that, if possible, you would have dug out your eyes and
have given them to me. <sup class="v">4:16</sup>Have I therefore
become your enemy, by telling you the truth? <sup class=
"v">4:17</sup>They are zealous for you, but not well, but they wish
to exclude you that you may be zealous for them. <sup class=
"v">4:18</sup>It is good to be zealous for a good object always,
and not only when I am present with you. <sup class=
"v">4:19</sup>My little children, with whom I am again in pain till
Christ is formed in you, <sup class="v">4:20</sup>I wish to be
present with you now and change my voice with you, for I am in
doubt of you.</p>
<p class="pin">8 <sup class="v">4:21</sup>Tell me, you that wish
to be under the law, do you not hear the law? <sup class=
"v">4:22</sup>For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, one by
a servant woman, and the other by a free woman. <sup class=
"v">4:23</sup>But he by the servant woman was born of the flesh,
and he by the free woman, by the promise. <sup class=
"v">4:24</sup>These things are allegorical, for those [women] are
two covenants, one from Mount Sinai, bearing children for
servitude, which is Hagar; <sup class="v">4:25</sup>for Hagar is
Mount Sinai in Arabia; and the present Jerusalem answers to her,
for she is in servitude with her children. <sup class=
"v">4:26</sup>But the Jerusalem above is free, which is the mother
of us; <sup class="v">4:27</sup>for it is written, Rejoice, barren
woman, that did not bear, break forth and cry, woman that had no
pain, for the children of the desolate are more numerous than those
of her who had a husband. <sup class="v">4:28</sup>But we,
brothers, like Isaac, are children of the promise. <sup class=
"v">4:29</sup>But as then he that was born of the flesh persecuted
him that was born of the Spirit, so also now. <sup class=
"v">4:30</sup>But what says the Scripture? Cast out the
servant-woman and her son; for the son of the servant woman shall
not be an heir, with the son of the free. <sup class=
"v">4:31</sup>Wherefore, brothers, we are not children of the
servant woman, but of the free.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<h3>MORAL DUTIES.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">5:1</sup>STAND firm in the
liberty with which Christ has made you free, and be not again
subject to a yoke of servitude. <sup class="v">5:2</sup>Behold, I
Paul tell you, that if you are circumcised Christ will not profit
you. <sup class="v">5:3</sup>For I testify again to every man that
is circumcised, that he is bound to perform the whole law.
<sup class="v">5:4</sup>You have departed from Christ, whoever of
you are justified by the law, you have fallen from the grace.
<sup class="v">5:5</sup>For we wait in spirit for the hope of
righteousness, by faith. <sup class="v">5:6</sup>For in Christ
Jesus neither circumcision avails any thing nor uncircumcision, but
faith which works by love.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">5:7</sup>You ran well; who
hindered you from obeying the truth? <sup class="v">5:8</sup>This
persuasion is not of him that calls you. <sup class="v">5:9</sup>A
little leaven leavens the whole mass. <sup class="v">5:10</sup>I
have confidence in you, in the Lord, that you will not be of
another mind; but he that troubles you shall bear his sin, whoever
he is. <sup class="v">5:11</sup>And I, brothers, if I preach
circumcision, why am I yet persecuted? Then has the offense of the
cross ceased. <sup class="v">5:12</sup>I would that they were cut
off that disturb you. <sup class="v">5:13</sup>For you are called
to liberty, brothers, only make not your liberty an occasion for
the flesh, but by love serve one another. <sup class=
"v">5:14</sup>For all the law is fully contained in one precept;
you shall love your neighbor as yourself. <sup class=
"v">5:15</sup>But if you bite and devour one another, see that you
be not consumed one by another.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">5:16</sup>And I say, walk in the
Spirit and perform not the desire of the flesh. <sup class=
"v">5:17</sup>For the flesh desires against the Spirit, and the
Spirit against the flesh; and these are opposed one to another, so
that you do not what you wish. <sup class="v">5:18</sup>But if you
are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law. <sup class=
"v">5:19</sup>For the works of the flesh are manifest, which are,
fornication, impurity, lewdness, <sup class="v">5:20</sup>idolatry,
magic, enmities, strife, envy, anger, contentions, dissensions,
heresies, <sup class="v">5:21</sup>murders, drunkenness, revellings
and the like, of which I tell you before, as I have also previously
told you, that those who do such things shall not inherit the
kingdom of God. <sup class="v">5:22</sup>But the fruit of the
Spirit is love, joy, peace, long suffering, kindness, goodness,
faith, <sup class="v">5:23</sup>meekness, temperance; against such
there is no law. <sup class="v">5:24</sup>And the [subjects] of
Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its affections and
desires. <sup class="v">5:25</sup>If we live in the Spirit, let us
also walk in the Spirit. <sup class="v">5:26</sup>Let us not be
desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one
another.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">6:1</sup>Brothers, if a man is
overtaken with any fault, do you that are spiritual restore such a
one with a spirit of meekness, considering yourself; lest you also
be tried. <sup class="v">6:2</sup>Bear one another's burdens, and
so perform the law of Christ. <sup class="v">6:3</sup>For if any
one thinks he is something, when he is nothing, he deceives
himself. <sup class="v">6:4</sup>But let each one prove his work,
and then shall he have joy in himself alone and not in another,
<sup class="v">6:5</sup>for every one shall bear his own
burden.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">6:6</sup>Let him that is taught
the word communicate with him that teaches of all good things.
<sup class="v">6:7</sup>Be not deceived, God is not mocked. For
what a man sows, that shall he also reap; <sup class=
"v">6:8</sup>for he that sows for his flesh, shall of the flesh
reap destruction; but he that sows for the Spirit, shall of the
Spirit reap life eternal. <sup class="v">6:9</sup>Let us not be
weary of well doing; for in due season we shall reap if we faint
not. <sup class="v">6:10</sup>As we have opportunity, therefore,
let us do good to all, but especially to the members of the family
of the faith.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">6:11</sup>You see with how long a
letter I have written to you. <sup class="v">6:12</sup>Those who
wish to make a fair appearance in the flesh compel you to be
circumcised, only that they may not be persecuted for the cross of
Christ. <sup class="v">6:13</sup>For the circumcised themselves do
not keep the law, but they wish you to be circumcised that they may
glory in your flesh. <sup class="v">6:14</sup>But far be it from me
to glory, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the
world is crucified to me and I to the world. <sup class=
"v">6:15</sup>For in Christ Jesus neither is circumcision any
thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation. <sup class=
"v">6:16</sup>And whoever walk by this rule, peace and mercy be on
them, and on the Israel of God.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">6:17</sup>Finally, let no man
trouble me; for I bear in my body the marks of Jesus. <sup class=
"v">6:18</sup>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your
spirit, brothers; amen.</p>

<h3>SALUTATION, EXHORTATION TO UNITY, THE MYSTERY OF THE GOSPEL,
ETC.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">1:1</sup>PAUL, called to be an
apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Sosthenes the
brother, <sup class="v">1:2</sup>to the church of God which is at
Corinth, to the sanctified in Jesus Christ, called to be saints,
with all that call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every
place, both theirs and ours. <sup class="v">1:3</sup>Grace and
peace be to you from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">1:4</sup>I thank my God always
for you, for the grace of God given you in Christ Jesus,
<sup class="v">1:5</sup>that in every thing you are enriched in
him, in all speech and all knowledge, <sup class="v">1:6</sup>as
the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you, <sup class=
"v">1:7</sup>so that you are behind in no gift, waiting for the
revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ, <sup class="v">1:8</sup>who
also will confirm you to the end, without blame, in the day of our
Lord Jesus Christ. <sup class="v">1:9</sup>God is faithful by whom
you are called into the society of his Son Jesus Christ our
Lord.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">1:10</sup>I exhort you, brothers,
by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same
thing, and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be
perfected in the same mind and the same will. <sup class=
"v">1:11</sup>For I have been informed of you, my brothers, by the
family of Chloe, that there are contentions among you. <sup class=
"v">1:12</sup>I mean this; that each one of you says I indeed am of
Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ.
<sup class="v">1:13</sup>Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for
you? or were you baptized in the name of Paul? <sup class=
"v">1:14</sup>I thank God I baptized none of you, except Crispus
and Gaius; <sup class="v">1:15</sup>that no one may say that I
baptized in my name. <sup class="v">1:16</sup>And I also baptized
the family of Stephanus; besides I do not know that I baptized any
other. <sup class="v">1:17</sup>For Christ sent me not to baptize
but to preach the good news, not with a wisdom of speech lest the
cross of Christ should be without effect. <sup class=
"v">1:18</sup>For the word of the cross is to the lost foolishness,
but to the saved the power of God. <sup class="v">1:19</sup>For it
is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring
to nothing the understanding of the intelligent. <sup class=
"v">1:20</sup>Where is the wise? where the scribe? where the
disputer of this life? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the
world? <sup class="v">1:21</sup>For since, in the wisdom of God,
the world by wisdom knew not God, God was pleased by the
foolishness of preaching to save those that believe; <sup class=
"v">1:22</sup>and since the Jews seek signs, and the Greeks seek
wisdom, <sup class="v">1:23</sup>we preach Christ crucified, to the
Jews indeed an offense, and to the gentiles foolishness,
<sup class="v">1:24</sup>but to the called, both Jews and Greeks,
Christ the power of God and wisdom of God; <sup class=
"v">1:25</sup>for the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the
weakness of God is stronger than men. <sup class="v">1:26</sup>For
you see your calling, brothers, that not many wise according to the
flesh, not many mighty, not many noble [are called]; <sup class=
"v">1:27</sup>but God has chosen the foolish things of the world to
confound the wise, and the weak things of the world has God chosen
to put to shame the mighty, <sup class="v">1:28</sup>and the
ignoble things of the world and things that are despised has God
chosen, and things that are not, to destroy things that are,
<sup class="v">1:29</sup>that no flesh may glory in the sight of
God. <sup class="v">1:30</sup>But you are of him in Christ Jesus,
who has become to us wisdom from God, and righteousness, and
sanctification and redemption, <sup class="v">1:31</sup>that as it
is written, He that glories, let him glory in the Lord.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">2:1</sup>And when I came to you,
brothers, I came not with excellency of speech, or wisdom,
declaring to you the mystery of God. <sup class="v">2:2</sup>For I
determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and him
crucified. <sup class="v">2:3</sup>And I was with you in weakness,
and with fear and with much trembling, <sup class="v">2:4</sup>and
my speech and my preaching were not with persuasive words of
wisdom, but with a demonstration of the spirit and power,
<sup class="v">2:5</sup>that your faith might not be in the wisdom
of men but in the power of God.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">2:6</sup>But we speak wisdom
among the perfect, but not the wisdom of this life, nor of the
rulers of this life, who are destroyed; <sup class="v">2:7</sup>but
we speak a wisdom of God hid in mystery, which God appointed from
eternity for our glory, <sup class="v">2:8</sup>which none of the
rulers of this life knew, for if they had known they would not have
crucified the Lord of glory; <sup class="v">2:9</sup>but as it is
written, An eye has not seen, an ear has not heard, neither have
entered into the heart of man the things which God has prepared for
those that love him; <sup class="v">2:10</sup>but God has revealed
them to us by his Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, even
the depths of God. <sup class="v">2:11</sup>For who knows the
[things] of man, except the spirit of man which is in him? So also
no one knows the [things] of God except the Spirit of God.
<sup class="v">2:12</sup>And we have received not the spirit of the
world, but the Spirit which is of God, that we may know the things
given us by God, <sup class="v">2:13</sup>which we also speak, not
in words taught by human wisdom, but in those taught by the Spirit,
comparing spiritual things with spiritual. <sup class=
"v">2:14</sup>But the natural man receives not the [things] of the
Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot know
them, for they are spiritually discerned. <sup class=
"v">2:15</sup>But the spiritual man discerns all things, and is
himself perceived by no one. <sup class="v">2:16</sup>For who has
known the mind of the Lord, who shall instruct him? But we have the
mind of Christ.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">3:1</sup>And I, brothers, was not
able to speak to you as spiritual, but as carnal, as babes in
Christ. <sup class="v">3:2</sup>I have fed you milk, not solid
food; for you were not yet able; but you are not able even now;
<sup class="v">3:3</sup>for you are yet carnal. For when there is
envy and strife among you are you not carnal and walk as men?
<sup class="v">3:4</sup>For when one says, I am of Paul, and
another, I, of Apollos, are you not men? <sup class=
"v">3:5</sup>Who then is Apollos? and who is Paul? but ministers by
whom you believed, and to each as the Lord gave. <sup class=
"v">3:6</sup>I planted, Apollos watered, but God caused [the seed]
to grow; <sup class="v">3:7</sup>so neither is he that plants any
thing, nor he that waters, but God that causes it to grow.
<sup class="v">3:8</sup>He that plants and he that waters are one;
and each shall receive his reward according to his labor.
<sup class="v">3:9</sup>For we are God's co-laborers; you are God's
field, God's building.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">3:10</sup>According to the grace
of God given me as a wise architect I have laid a foundation, and
another builds on it. But let each one see how he builds on it.
<sup class="v">3:11</sup>For no one can lay another foundation
besides that laid, which is Christ Jesus. <sup class=
"v">3:12</sup>And if any man builds on this foundation, gold,
silver, precious stones, wood, grass, reeds, <sup class=
"v">3:13</sup>each one's work shall be manifest; for the day shall
show it, because it shall be revealed by fire, and the same fire
shall try every man's work what it is. <sup class="v">3:14</sup>If
any one's work continues which he has built, he shall receive a
reward; <sup class="v">3:15</sup>if any one's work is consumed, he
shall suffer loss, and he shall be saved, but so as by fire.</p>
<p class="pin">8 <sup class="v">3:16</sup>Know you not that you
are a temple of God and the Spirit of God dwells in you?
<sup class="v">3:17</sup>If any one destroys the temple of God, him
shall God destroy; for the temple of God which you are is holy.
<sup class="v">3:18</sup>Let no one deceive himself; if any one
seems to be wise among you in this life, let him be a fool, that he
may be wise. <sup class="v">3:19</sup>For the wisdom of this world
is foolishness with God. For it is written; He takes the wise in
their craftiness. <sup class="v">3:20</sup>And again; The Lord
knows the thoughts of the wise that they are vain. <sup class=
"v">3:21</sup>Let no one therefore glory in men; for all things are
yours, <sup class="v">3:22</sup>whether Paul, or Apollos, or
Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or
things to come, all are yours, <sup class="v">3:23</sup>and you
Christ's, and Christ God's.</p>
<p class="pin">9 <sup class="v">4:1</sup>Let a man so regard us
as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God.
<sup class="v">4:2</sup>But, moreover, it is required of stewards
that one should be found faithful. <sup class="v">4:3</sup>But it
is of little account to me that I should be judged by you or by
man's day [judgment]; but I judge not myself; <sup class=
"v">4:4</sup>for I am not conscious to myself [of wrong], but I am
not on this account justified; but he that judges me is the Lord.
<sup class="v">4:5</sup>Judge nothing therefore before the time,
till the Lord comes, who will both bring to light the hidden deeds
of darkness, and make known the purposes of the hearts; and then
shall each one have praise from God.</p>
<p class="pin">10 <sup class="v">4:6</sup>I have applied these
things figuratively, brothers, to myself and Apollos on your
account, that you may learn by us not to [go beyond] what is
written, that you may not be puffed up for one against another.
<sup class="v">4:7</sup>For who made you to differ? And what have
you that you did not receive? And if you received, why do you boast
as one that receives not? <sup class="v">4:8</sup>You are already
full, you are already enriched; you have reigned without us; and I
would that you did reign, that we also might reign with you.
<sup class="v">4:9</sup>For I think that God has shown us the
apostles last, as devoted to death, for we have been made a
spectacle to the world, both to angels and men. <sup class=
"v">4:10</sup>For we are foolish for Christ's sake, but you are
wise in Christ; we are weak, but you are strong; and you are
glorious, but we are infamous. <sup class="v">4:11</sup>Even to
this hour we suffer hunger and thirst and nakedness, and are
beaten, and are unsettled, <sup class="v">4:12</sup>and labor,
working with our hands; being reviled we bless, being persecuted we
endure, <sup class="v">4:13</sup>being defamed we entreat; we are
made like the offscouring of the world and the vilest of all
things, even till now.</p>
<p class="pin">11 <sup class="v">4:14</sup>I write these things
not to shame you, but as my beloved children, I admonish you.
<sup class="v">4:15</sup>For if you have ten thousand teachers in
Christ still you have not many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I have
begotten you by the gospel. <sup class="v">4:16</sup>I exhort you
therefore, be followers of me. <sup class="v">4:17</sup>For this
reason I sent you Timothy, who is my beloved and faithful son in
the Lord, who will remind you of my ways in Christ, as I teach
everywhere, in every church. <sup class="v">4:18</sup>Some are
puffed up as though I would not come to you; <sup class=
"v">4:19</sup>but I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and
will know not the word of those who are puffed up but the power;
<sup class="v">4:20</sup>for the kingdom of God is not in word, but
in power. <sup class="v">4:21</sup>What do you wish? shall I come
to you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of meekness?</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<h3>INCEST, LITIGATION, EXPEDIENCY, AND CHASTITY.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">5:1</sup>IT is commonly reported
that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not
among the gentiles, that a man should have his father's wife.
<sup class="v">5:2</sup>And you are puffed up, and have not rather
mourned, that he who has done this deed should be removed from
among you. <sup class="v">5:3</sup>For I indeed as absent in body,
but present in spirit, have already judged as present him that has
so done this, <sup class="v">5:4</sup>in the name of our Lord Jesus
you being assembled together and my spirit with the power of our
Lord Jesus <sup class="v">5:5</sup>to deliver such a one to Satan
for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in
the day of the Lord. <sup class="v">5:6</sup>Your rejoicing is not
good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole mass?
<sup class="v">5:7</sup>Remove the old leaven, that you may be a
new mass, as you are unleavened; for Christ our passover was also
sacrificed for us. <sup class="v">5:8</sup>Let us therefore keep
the feast, not with old leaven, nor with a leaven of vice and
wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and
truth.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">5:9</sup>I wrote to you in the
epistle not to associate with fornicators; <sup class=
"v">5:10</sup>not altogether the fornicators of this world, or the
covetous and rapacious, or idolaters, since then you would have to
go out of the world. <sup class="v">5:11</sup>But now I have
written to you not to associate, if any one called a brother is a
fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a
drunkard, or rapacious, even to eat with such a one. <sup class=
"v">5:12</sup>For what business have I to judge those without? Do
you not judge those within? <sup class="v">5:13</sup>but those
without, God judges. Remove therefore the evil man from among
you.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">6:1</sup>Dare any of you having a
business with another be judged by the wicked, and not by the
saints? <sup class="v">6:2</sup>Do you not know that the saints
shall judge the world? And if the world is judged by you, are you
unworthy of the lowest courts? <sup class="v">6:3</sup>Know you not
that we shall judge angels? Much more then things pertaining to
this life? <sup class="v">6:4</sup>If then you have courts for the
business of this life, do you constitute them of the most abject in
the church? <sup class="v">6:5</sup>I speak to your shame. Is there
not now a wise man among you? not one who can judge between his
brothers? <sup class="v">6:6</sup>But brother goes to law with
brother, and that before unbelievers. <sup class="v">6:7</sup>Now
therefore there is a great fault among you, that you go to law one
with another. Why not rather suffer injustice? why not rather be
defrauded? <sup class="v">6:8</sup>But you injure and defraud, and
that your brothers. <sup class="v">6:9</sup>Know you not that the
unjust shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived;
neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor the
effeminate, nor sodomites, <sup class="v">6:10</sup>nor thieves,
nor covetous persons, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor the
rapacious, shall inherit the kingdom of God. <sup class=
"v">6:11</sup>And such were some of you; but you are washed, you
are sanctified, but you are justified in the name of the Lord
Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">6:12</sup>All things are lawful
for me, but all things are not expedient; all things are lawful,
but I will not be brought under the power of any. <sup class=
"v">6:13</sup>Food for the stomach, and the stomach for food; but
God will destroy both it and them. And the body is not for
fornication but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body;
<sup class="v">6:14</sup>and God both raised the Lord, and will
raise us up by his power. <sup class="v">6:15</sup>Know you not
that your bodies are Christ's members? Shall I then take the
members of Christ and make them a harlot's members? by no means.
<sup class="v">6:16</sup>Know you not that he who is joined to a
harlot is one body [with her]? For the two, says he, shall be one
flesh. <sup class="v">6:17</sup>But he that is joined to the Lord
is one spirit [with him]. <sup class="v">6:18</sup>Avoid
fornication. Every crime that a man commits is out of his body; but
he that commits fornication sins in his body. <sup class=
"v">6:19</sup>Know you not that your bodies are a temple of the
Holy Spirit in you which you have from God, and you are not your
own? <sup class="v">6:20</sup>For you are bought with a price;
therefore glorify God in your body.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<h3>MARRIAGE, CELIBACY, ETC., AND THINGS OFFERED TO IDOLS.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">7:1</sup>CONCERNING what you
wrote to me, it is good for a man not to touch a woman; <sup class=
"v">7:2</sup>but on account of fornications, let each man have his
wife, and each woman have her husband. <sup class="v">7:3</sup>Let
the husband render to the wife her due, and in like manner also the
wife the husband. <sup class="v">7:4</sup>The wife has not the
right to her body, but the husband; and in like manner the husband
has not the right to his body, but the wife. <sup class=
"v">7:5</sup>Withhold not yourselves from one another, except by
agreement for a time that you may be at leisure for prayer, and
come together again, that Satan may not tempt you by your
incontinence. <sup class="v">7:6</sup>But this I say by suggestion,
not by command. <sup class="v">7:7</sup>For I wish that all men
were even as I am; but each one has his gift from God, and one is
of one kind and another of another.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">7:8</sup>And I say to the
unmarried and to the widows, that it is good for them to continue
as I am; <sup class="v">7:9</sup>but if they have not self-control,
let them marry; it is better to marry than to be incontinent.
<sup class="v">7:10</sup>But the married I charge, not I, but the
Lord, Let not a wife separate from her husband, <sup class=
"v">7:11</sup>and also if she is separated let her remain unmarried
or be reconciled to the husband, and let not a husband leave his
wife.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">7:12</sup>But to the rest I
speak, not the Lord, If any brother has an unbelieving wife, and
she is pleased to live with him, let him not leave her; <sup class=
"v">7:13</sup>and if any wife has an unbelieving husband and he is
pleased to live with her, let her not leave the husband.
<sup class="v">7:14</sup>For the unbelieving husband is sanctified
by the believing wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by
the brother; else were your children impure, but now are they holy.
<sup class="v">7:15</sup>But if the unbelieving companion departs,
let him depart; the brother or the sister is not bound in such
cases; but God has called us to peace. <sup class="v">7:16</sup>For
how do you know, wife, that you will not save your husband? or how
do you know, husband, that you will not save your wife?</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">7:17</sup>Unless as the Lord has
imparted to each one, as God has called each one, so let him walk;
and so I appoint in all the churches. <sup class="v">7:18</sup>Is
any one called being circumcised, let him not be uncircumcised; is
any one called in uncircumcision, let him not be circumcised.
<sup class="v">7:19</sup>Circumcision is nothing, and
uncircumcision is nothing, but keeping God's commandments.
<sup class="v">7:20</sup>Let each one remain in the calling in
which he was called; <sup class="v">7:21</sup>were you called being
a servant, care not for it; but if you can be free, use it rather.
<sup class="v">7:22</sup>For the servant called in the Lord is the
Lord's freeman; in like manner the called freeman is Christ's
servant. <sup class="v">7:23</sup>You are bought with a price; be
not servants of men. <sup class="v">7:24</sup>Let each one
continue, brothers, in the calling in which he was called under
God.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">7:25</sup>And concerning the
virgins I have no ordinance of the Lord, but I give an opinion as
one that has obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful. <sup class=
"v">7:26</sup>I think then that this is good on account of the
present necessity, because it is good for man to be so. <sup class=
"v">7:27</sup>Are you bound to a wife, seek not a release; are you
released from a wife, seek not a wife. <sup class="v">7:28</sup>But
if you marry, you do not sin and if the virgin marries she does not
sin. But such will have affliction in the flesh; but I spare you.
<sup class="v">7:29</sup>But this I say, brothers, the time is
short, so that in future those who have wives should be as those
not having them, <sup class="v">7:30</sup>and those who weep as
those not weeping, and those who rejoice as those not rejoicing,
and those who buy as not possessing, <sup class="v">7:31</sup>and
those who use the world as those not abusing it; for the fashion of
this world passes away. <sup class="v">7:32</sup>But I wish you to
be without cares. The unmarried man cares for the things of the
Lord, how he shall please the Lord; <sup class="v">7:33</sup>but he
that is married cares for the things of the world, how he shall
please the wife. <sup class="v">7:34</sup>And the wife and the
virgin are different; the unmarried woman cares for the things of
the Lord, that she may be holy in body and spirit; but she that is
married cares for the things of the world, how she shall please the
husband. <sup class="v">7:35</sup>But I say this for your own
profit; not to impose a snare on you, but for [your] honor, and
[your] attending on the Lord without distraction.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">7:36</sup>But if any one thinks
that he behaves improperly to his virgin, if she is past her prime,
and it must be so, let him do what he wishes; he does not sin; let
them marry. <sup class="v">7:37</sup>But he that stands firm in
mind, not having a necessity, but has power over his will, and has
determined in his mind to keep his virgin, does well. <sup class=
"v">7:38</sup>He that gives in marriage therefore does well, and he
that gives not in marriage does better.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">7:39</sup>A woman is bound as
long as her husband lives; but if her husband is dead then she is
free to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord. <sup class=
"v">7:40</sup>But she is happier if she continues thus, in my
opinion, and I think also I have the Spirit of God.</p>
<p class="pin">8 <sup class="v">8:1</sup>And concerning things
offered to idols we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but
love edifies. <sup class="v">8:2</sup>And if any one thinks he
knows any thing, he yet knows nothing as he ought to know;
<sup class="v">8:3</sup>but if any one loves God, this [man] is
known by him. <sup class="v">8:4</sup>Concerning eating things
offered to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and
that there is no other God but one. <sup class="v">8:5</sup>For
even if there are those called Gods, whether in heaven or on earth,
as there are many gods and many lords, <sup class="v">8:6</sup>yet
to us there is one God the Father, of whom are all things, and we
in him, and one Lord Jesus Christ, through whom are all things and
we through him. <sup class="v">8:7</sup>But all have not this
knowledge; and some with the conscience [unenlightened] even till
now eat an idol's [sacrifice] as an idol's sacrifice, and their
conscience being weak is defiled. <sup class="v">8:8</sup>But food
does not commend us to God; for neither if we eat not are we worse,
nor if we eat are we better. <sup class="v">8:9</sup>But beware
lest your liberty should become an offense to the weak. <sup class=
"v">8:10</sup>For if any one sees you who have knowledge reclining
in an idol's temple, will not the conscience of him that is weak be
emboldened to eat things offered to idols? <sup class=
"v">8:11</sup>And will not the weak brother for whom Christ died
perish by your knowledge? <sup class="v">8:12</sup>But when you
thus sin against the brothers, and wound their weak conscience, you
sin against Christ. <sup class="v">8:13</sup>Wherefore, if food
offends my brother, I will eat no meat forever, that I may not
offend my brother.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<h3>THE CHRISTIAN MINISTRY ENTITLED TO A SUPPORT, PAUL'S LABORS
WITHOUT CHARGE.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">9:1</sup>AM I not a freeman? Am I
not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? Are not you
my work in the Lord? <sup class="v">9:2</sup>If I am not an apostle
to others, I certainly am to you; for you are a seal of my
apostleship in the Lord. <sup class="v">9:3</sup>My defense to
those who condemn me is this; <sup class="v">9:4</sup>Have we not a
right to eat and drink? <sup class="v">9:5</sup>Have we not a right
to lead about a sister, a wife, as also the other apostles; and the
brothers of the Lord, and Cephas? <sup class="v">9:6</sup>Or I only
and Barnabas, have we not a right to abstain from labor?
<sup class="v">9:7</sup>Who ever goes on a military expedition at
his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and eats not the fruit of
it? or who feeds a flock and eats not of the milk of the flock?
<sup class="v">9:8</sup>Do I say these things in the manner of men?
or does not the law also say the same? <sup class="v">9:9</sup>For
it is written in the law of Moses, You shall not muzzle the ox that
threshes. Does God care for oxen? <sup class="v">9:10</sup>or does
he speak entirely for our sakes? For our sakes, doubtless, it was
written, that he who plows should plow in hope, and that he who
threshes in hope should partake of it. <sup class="v">9:11</sup>If
we have sown for you spiritual things, is it too much if we reap
your earthly things? <sup class="v">9:12</sup>And if others have
this right, do we not have it more? But we have not used this
right, but endure all things, that we may not impede the gospel of
Christ. <sup class="v">9:13</sup>Know you not that those who
perform sacred rites eat from the temple? Those who wait on the
altar partake of the altar? <sup class="v">9:14</sup>So also the
Lord has appointed to those who preach the gospel to live by the
gospel. <sup class="v">9:15</sup>But I have used none of these
things, and I have not written these things that it should be so
done to me; for I prefer to die, rather than that any one should
make my boasting vain.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">9:16</sup>For if I preach the
gospel I have nothing to boast of; for a necessity is laid upon me;
for woe is me, if I preach not the gospel. <sup class=
"v">9:17</sup>For if I do this willingly, I have a reward; but if
unwillingly, I am intrusted with a stewardship. <sup class=
"v">9:18</sup>What then is my reward? That preaching I may make the
gospel without expense, that I may not abuse my right in the
gospel. <sup class="v">9:19</sup>For being free from all men, I
have made myself a servant of all, that I may gain more;
<sup class="v">9:20</sup>to the Jews I have been as a Jew, that I
might gain the Jews; to those under the law, as under the law, not
being myself under the law, that I might gain those under the law;
<sup class="v">9:21</sup>to those without law, as without law,
being not without law to God, but with law to Christ, that I might
gain those without law; <sup class="v">9:22</sup>to the weak I have
been as weak, that I might gain the weak; I have been all things to
all men, that I may save some in all conditions; <sup class=
"v">9:23</sup>and I do all things for the sake of the gospel, that
I may be a partaker of it.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">9:24</sup>Know you not that those
who run in the race all indeed run, but one takes the prize. So run
that you may obtain. <sup class="v">9:25</sup>And every one that
contends in the games is temperate in all things, they indeed to
obtain a perishable crown, we an imperishable. <sup class=
"v">9:26</sup>I therefore so run, not as uncertainly, and so
strike, not as one who beats the air; <sup class="v">9:27</sup>but
I brow-beat my body, and bring it into subjection, lest having
preached to others I should myself be a reprobate.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">10:1</sup>For I wish you not to
be ignorant, brothers, that all our fathers were under the cloud,
and all passed through the sea, <sup class="v">10:2</sup>and all
were baptized to Moses by the cloud and by the sea, <sup class=
"v">10:3</sup>and all eat the same spiritual food, <sup class=
"v">10:4</sup>and all drank the same spiritual drink; for they
drank of the spiritual rock which followed them, and that rock was
Christ; <sup class="v">10:5</sup>but with many of them God was not
pleased; for they were destroyed in the wilderness. <sup class=
"v">10:6</sup>But these things are examples for us, that we should
not desire evil things, as they did. <sup class=
"v">10:7</sup>Neither be idolaters, as some of them were, as it is
written; The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.
<sup class="v">10:8</sup>Neither let us commit fornication, as some
of them did and fell in one day twenty-three thousand. <sup class=
"v">10:9</sup>Neither let us try Christ, as some of them did and
were destroyed by serpents. <sup class="v">10:10</sup>Neither do
you complain as some of them complained and were destroyed by the
destroyer. <sup class="v">10:11</sup>All these things happened to
them as examples, and are recorded for our admonition on whom the
ends of the ages have come; <sup class="v">10:12</sup>so that he
who thinks he stands, let him take heed lest he fall. <sup class=
"v">10:13</sup>For no trial has befallen you but what is common to
man; and God is faithful, who will not permit you to be tried
beyond what you are able, but with the trial will order the event,
that you may be able to endure.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">10:14</sup>Wherefore, my beloved,
avoid idolatry. <sup class="v">10:15</sup>I speak as to wise men;
judge what I say. <sup class="v">10:16</sup>The cup of blessing
which we bless, is it not a participation of the blood of Christ?
The bread which we break, is it not a participation of the body of
Christ? <sup class="v">10:17</sup>For we, being many, are one
bread, one body; for we all partake of the one bread. <sup class=
"v">10:18</sup>Consider Israel after the flesh; are not those who
eat the sacrifices partakers of the altar? <sup class=
"v">10:19</sup>What then do I say? that an idol sacrifice is any
thing, or that an idol is any thing? <sup class="v">10:20</sup>But
what the gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons, and not to
God; and I do not wish you to be partakers with demons. <sup class=
"v">10:21</sup>You cannot drink the Lord's cup and the cup of
demons; you cannot partake at the Lord's table and the table of
demons. <sup class="v">10:22</sup>Do we provoke the Lord to anger?
Are we stronger than he?</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">10:23</sup>All things are lawful,
but all things are not expedient; all things are lawful, but all
things do not edify. <sup class="v">10:24</sup>Let no one seek his
own but the good of another. <sup class="v">10:25</sup>Whatever is
sold in the market eat, asking no questions for conscience' sake;
<sup class="v">10:26</sup>for the earth is the Lord's and all it
contains. <sup class="v">10:27</sup>But if an unbeliever invites
you and you wish to go, eat whatever is set before you, asking no
questions for conscience' sake. <sup class="v">10:28</sup>But if
any one says to you, This has been offered to an idol, eat not for
his sake that informed you, and for conscience' sake. <sup class=
"v">10:29</sup>I mean not your conscience, but that of the other.
For why is my freedom limited by the conscience of another?
<sup class="v">10:30</sup>If I partake with thanks, why am I blamed
for that for which I give thanks? <sup class="v">10:31</sup>Whether
then you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of
God. <sup class="v">10:32</sup>Be without offense both to Jews and
Greeks, and the church of God, <sup class="v">10:33</sup>as I also
please all in all things, not seeking my own profit but that of
many, that they may be saved. <sup class="v">11:1</sup>Be followers
of me as I also am of Christ.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>
<h3>PUBLIC WORSHIP, THE LORD'S SUPPER.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">11:2</sup>I COMMEND you,
brothers, that you have remembered all my [instructions], and that
you retain the traditions as I delivered them to you. <sup class=
"v">11:3</sup>But I wish you to know that the head of every man is
Christ, and the head of the woman, the man, and the head of Christ,
God. <sup class="v">11:4</sup>Every man praying or prophesying with
his head covered disgraces his head. <sup class="v">11:5</sup>But
every woman praying or prophesying with her head uncovered
disgraces her head; for it is one and the same as if she was
shaved. <sup class="v">11:6</sup>For if a woman is not veiled then
let her hair be cut off; but if it is disgraceful for a woman to
have her hair cut off, or to be shaved, let her wear a veil.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">11:7</sup>For a man ought not to
cover his head, being an image and glory of God; but the woman is a
glory of man. <sup class="v">11:8</sup>For man is not of woman, but
woman of man; <sup class="v">11:9</sup>for man also was not created
because of the woman, but woman because of the man. <sup class=
"v">11:10</sup>For this reason ought the woman to have a power
[veil] on her head because of the angels. <sup class=
"v">11:11</sup>But neither is woman without man, nor man without
woman in the Lord; <sup class="v">11:12</sup>for as the woman is of
the man, so also the man is through the woman, but all things are
from God. <sup class="v">11:13</sup>Judge of yourselves; is it
becoming that a woman should pray to God unveiled? <sup class=
"v">11:14</sup>Does not nature herself teach you that if a man
wears long hair it is a disgrace to him? <sup class=
"v">11:15</sup>but if a woman wears long hair it is her glory; for
the hair is given her for a covering. <sup class="v">11:16</sup>But
if any one is disposed to be contentious, we have no such custom
neither have the churches of God.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">11:17</sup>But I tell you this,
not to praise you, that you come together not for the better but
for the worse. <sup class="v">11:18</sup>For first, when you come
together in an assembly, I hear that there are divisions among you,
and some part of it I believe. <sup class="v">11:19</sup>For it is
necessary that there should be heresies among you, that the
approved may be manifest among you. <sup class="v">11:20</sup>When
you come together therefore, it is not to eat the Lord's supper,
<sup class="v">11:21</sup>for each one in eating takes his supper
before the rest, and one is hungry and another drunk. <sup class=
"v">11:22</sup>Have you not [food] to eat and drink at your houses?
or do you despise the church of God, and shame those who have not
[houses]? What shall I say to you? Shall I commend you? In this I
commend you not.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">11:23</sup>For I received of the
Lord, what I also delivered to you; that on the night in which he
was betrayed, the Lord Jesus took bread <sup class=
"v">11:24</sup>and giving thanks broke, and said, This is my body,
which is for you; this do in remembrance of me. <sup class=
"v">11:25</sup>In like manner also the cup, after supper, saying,
This cup is the new covenant [sealed] with my blood; this do, as
often as you drink, in remembrance of me. <sup class=
"v">11:26</sup>For as often as you eat this bread and drink this
cup, you declare the Lord's death till he comes. <sup class=
"v">11:27</sup>So that whoever eats this bread or drinks this cup
of the Lord unworthily, is guilty of the body and blood of the
Lord. <sup class="v">11:28</sup>But let a man prove himself, and so
let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup; <sup class=
"v">11:29</sup>for he eats and drinks judgment to himself, who eats
and drinks not discerning the body.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">11:30</sup>For this reason many
are weak and sick among you and some sleep. <sup class=
"v">11:31</sup>For if we judged ourselves we should not be judged;
<sup class="v">11:32</sup>but being judged, we are chastened by the
Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world. <sup class=
"v">11:33</sup>Therefore, my brothers, when you come together to
eat, wait one for another. <sup class="v">11:34</sup>If any one is
hungry let him eat at home, that you come not together for
judgment. The other things I will arrange when I come.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<h3>SPIRITUAL GIFTS.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">12:1</sup>AND I wish you not to
be ignorant, brothers, of the spiritual gifts. <sup class=
"v">12:2</sup>You know that when you were gentiles, you followed
dumb idols as you were led. <sup class="v">12:3</sup>I assure you,
therefore, that no one speaking by the Spirit of God calls Jesus an
accursed thing, and no one can call Jesus Lord, except by the Holy
Spirit.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">12:4</sup>And there are
diversities of gifts but the same Spirit; <sup class=
"v">12:5</sup>and there are diversities of services and the same
Lord; <sup class="v">12:6</sup>and there are diversities of
operations and the same God, who performs all things in all.
<sup class="v">12:7</sup>But a manifestation of the Spirit is given
to each one for a useful purpose. <sup class="v">12:8</sup>For to
one is given by the Spirit a word of wisdom, and to another a word
of knowledge by the same Spirit, <sup class="v">12:9</sup>and to
another faith by the same Spirit, and to another gifts of
performing cures by the same Spirit, <sup class="v">12:10</sup>and
to another the performance of mighty works, and to another
prophecy, and to another discrimination of spirits, and to another
different tongues, and to another an interpretation of tongues;
<sup class="v">12:11</sup>but all these [works] performs one and
the same Spirit, distributing to each in particular as it
wills.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">12:12</sup>For as the body is one
and has many members, and all the members of the body being many
are one body, so also is Christ; <sup class="v">12:13</sup>for we
have all been baptized with one Spirit in one body, whether Jews or
Greeks, whether servants or freemen, and have all been made to
drink one Spirit. <sup class="v">12:14</sup>For the body also is
not one member but many. <sup class="v">12:15</sup>If the foot
says, Because I am not a hand, I am not of the body, is it
therefore not of the body? <sup class="v">12:16</sup>and if the ear
says, Because I am not an eye, I am not of the body, is it
therefore not of the body? <sup class="v">12:17</sup>If the whole
body was an eye, where would be the hearing? If the whole was a
hearing, where would be the smelling? <sup class="v">12:18</sup>But
now God has placed the members each one of them in the body, as he
pleased. <sup class="v">12:19</sup>But if all were one member,
where would be the body? <sup class="v">12:20</sup>But now there
are many members, but one body. <sup class="v">12:21</sup>The eye
cannot say to the hand, I have no need of you, or again, the head
to the feet, I have no need of you; <sup class="v">12:22</sup>but
much more those members of the body which seem to be weak are
necessary, <sup class="v">12:23</sup>and those which we esteem to
be less honorable members of the body, on these we bestow more
abundant honor, and our uncomely members have more abundant
comeliness, <sup class="v">12:24</sup>for our comely ones have no
need. But God has commingled the body, giving more abundant honor
to that part which was lacking, <sup class="v">12:25</sup>that
there should be no schism in the body, but that the members should
have the same care one for another. <sup class="v">12:26</sup>And
if one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; and if one
member is glorified, all the members rejoice with it.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">12:27</sup>And you are a body of
Christ, and members in particular. <sup class="v">12:28</sup>And
God has set some in the church, first apostles, secondly prophets,
thirdly teachers, then powers, then gifts of performing cures,
aids, governments, different tongues. <sup class="v">12:29</sup>Are
all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all powers?
<sup class="v">12:30</sup>have all gifts of performing cures? do
all speak with tongues? do all interpret? <sup class=
"v">12:31</sup>But desire earnestly the best gifts: and I will
still more fully show you the way.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">13:1</sup>If I speak with the
tongues of men and of angels and have not love, I am a sounding
brass and a tinkling cymbal. <sup class="v">13:2</sup>And if I have
prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge, and if I
have all faith so as to remove mountains, and have not love, I am
nothing. <sup class="v">13:3</sup>And if I deal out all my property
to feed the poor, and if I deliver my body to be burned, and have
not love, I shall not be profited.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">13:4</sup>Love suffers long and
is kind; love envies not; love is not boastful, is not puffed up,
<sup class="v">13:5</sup>does not behave unbecomingly, seeks not
her own, is not easily provoked, devises not evil, <sup class=
"v">13:6</sup>rejoices not in wickedness, but rejoices in the
truth; <sup class="v">13:7</sup>bears all things, believes all
things, hopes for all things, and endures all things.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">13:8</sup>Love never fails; but
if there are prophecies, they shall pass away; if tongues, they
shall cease; if knowledge, it shall pass away. <sup class=
"v">13:9</sup>And we know in part and we prophesy in part;
<sup class="v">13:10</sup>when the perfect has come, that which is
in part shall pass away. <sup class="v">13:11</sup>When I was a
child, I spoke as a child, I thought as a child, I reasoned as a
child; when I became a man I put away childish things. <sup class=
"v">13:12</sup>For now we see by a mirror darkly, but then we shall
see face to face; now I know in part, but then I shall know fully
as I also am known. <sup class="v">13:13</sup>And now remain faith,
hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these is love.</p>
<p class="pin">8 <sup class="v">14:1</sup>Cherish love, and be
earnestly desirous of spiritual gifts, but rather that you may
prophesy. <sup class="v">14:2</sup>For he that speaks with a tongue
speaks not to men but to God; for no one understands him, but in
spirit he speaks mysteries; <sup class="v">14:3</sup>but he that
prophesies speaks to men to edification and exhortation and
consolation. <sup class="v">14:4</sup>He that speaks with a tongue
edifies himself; but he that prophesies edifies an assembly.
<sup class="v">14:5</sup>I wish you all to speak with tongues, but
rather that you should prophesy; and he that prophesies is greater
than he that speaks with tongues, unless he interprets, that the
assembly may receive edification.</p>
<p class="pin">9 <sup class="v">14:6</sup>But now, brothers, if I
come to you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, unless
I speak to you by a revelation, or by a knowledge, or by a
prophecy, or by a doctrine? <sup class="v">14:7</sup>So of
irrational objects making a sound, whether a flute or harp; if it
makes no distinction of sounds, how shall it be known what is
played on the flute or harp? <sup class="v">14:8</sup>For also if
the trumpet gives an uncertain sound, who will prepare himself for
the battle? <sup class="v">14:9</sup>So also you by a tongue if you
utter a word not easily understood, how shall it be known what is
spoken? for you will speak to the air. <sup class=
"v">14:10</sup>There are perhaps as many kinds of voices in the
world, and no one is without significance; <sup class=
"v">14:11</sup>if therefore I do not know the meaning of the voice,
I shall be to him that speaks a barbarian, and he that speaks will
be a barbarian to me. <sup class="v">14:12</sup>So also you, since
you are earnestly desirous of spirits [spiritual gifts], seek to
abound for the edification of the church. <sup class=
"v">14:13</sup>Let him therefore that speaks with a tongue pray
that he may interpret, <sup class="v">14:14</sup>For if I pray with
a tongue, my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful.
<sup class="v">14:15</sup>What then is [to be done]? I will pray
with the spirit, I will pray also with the understanding; I will
sing with the spirit, I will sing also with the understanding;
<sup class="v">14:16</sup>since if you bless with the spirit, how
shall he that occupies the place of the unlearned say, Amen, to
your thanksgiving, since he knows not what you say? <sup class=
"v">14:17</sup>For you indeed give thanks well; but the other is
not edified. <sup class="v">14:18</sup>I thank God I speak with a
tongue more than you all; <sup class="v">14:19</sup>but in an
assembly I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that
I may also teach others, than ten thousand words in a tongue.</p>
<p class="pin">10 <sup class="v">14:20</sup>Brothers, be not
children in understanding, but in malice be children, and in
understanding be perfect men. <sup class="v">14:21</sup>For it is
written in the law, With other tongues, and with other lips will I
speak to this people, and so they shall not understand me, says the
Lord. <sup class="v">14:22</sup>Tongues therefore are a sign, not
for believers but for unbelievers, but prophecy is not for
unbelievers but for believers. <sup class="v">14:23</sup>If,
therefore, the whole church comes together, and all speak with
tongues, and there come in the unlearned and unbelieving, will they
not say that you are mad? <sup class="v">14:24</sup>But if all
prophesy, and there comes in an unbeliever or an unlearned man, he
is convinced by all, he is examined by all, <sup class=
"v">14:25</sup>and the secrets of his heart are made manifest, and
so falling down on his face he worships God, declaring that God is
really among you.</p>
<p class="pin">11 <sup class="v">14:26</sup>What then is [to be
done] brothers? When you come together, each one of you has a
psalm, has a doctrine, has a revelation, has an interpretation; let
all things be done for edification. <sup class="v">14:27</sup>If
any one speaks with a tongue, let it be by two or at most by three,
and by turns, and let one interpret; <sup class="v">14:28</sup>and
if there is no interpreter, let him be silent in the assembly, and
let him speak to himself and to God. <sup class="v">14:29</sup>Let
two or three prophets speak, and let the rest judge; <sup class=
"v">14:30</sup>but if any thing is revealed to another sitting by,
let the first be silent. <sup class="v">14:31</sup>For you can all
prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all be comforted.
<sup class="v">14:32</sup>And the spirits of prophets are subject
to the prophets; <sup class="v">14:33</sup>for God is not [the
friend] of disorder but of peace.</p>
<p class="pin">12 <sup class="v">14:34</sup>As in all the
churches of the saints, let your women keep silence in the
assemblies; for it is not permitted to them to speak, but to be in
subjection, as the law also says. <sup class="v">14:35</sup>But if
they wish to learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home;
for it is a shame for a woman to speak in an assembly. <sup class=
"v">14:36</sup>Did the word of God go out from you, or did it come
to you alone?</p>
<p class="pin">13 <sup class="v">14:37</sup>If any one thinks he
is a prophet, or a spiritual man, let him acknowledge the [things]
which I write to you, that they are the Lord's; <sup class=
"v">14:38</sup>but if any one is ignorant, let him be ignorant.
<sup class="v">14:39</sup>Therefore, brothers, desire earnestly to
prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues; <sup class=
"v">14:40</sup>but let all things be done becomingly and in
order.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<h3>THE RESURRECTION OF THE DEAD.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">15:1</sup>I DECLARE to you,
brothers, the gospel which I preached to you, which you also
received, in which also you stand, <sup class="v">15:2</sup>by
which also you are saved, if you adhere to the word we preached to
you, unless indeed you believed in vain. <sup class=
"v">15:3</sup>For I delivered to you at first, what I also
received, that Christ died for our sins according to the
Scriptures, <sup class="v">15:4</sup>and that he was buried, and
that he rose on the third day according to the Scriptures,
<sup class="v">15:5</sup>and that he appeared to Cephas, then to
the twelve. <sup class="v">15:6</sup>Afterwards he appeared to more
than five hundred brothers at once, of whom the most continue even
to the present time, but some have fallen asleep. <sup class=
"v">15:7</sup>Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles,
<sup class="v">15:8</sup>and last of all he appeared to me also, as
one born out of due time. <sup class="v">15:9</sup>For I am the
least of the apostles, and am not worthy to be called an apostle,
because I persecuted the church of God; <sup class=
"v">15:10</sup>but by the grace of God I am what I am, and his
grace to me was not in vain, but I labored more abundantly than
they all, but not I but the grace of God with me. <sup class=
"v">15:11</sup>Whether therefore it is I or they, so we preach, and
so you believed.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">15:12</sup>But if Christ is
preached that he was raised from the dead, how say some among you
that there is no resurrection of the dead? <sup class=
"v">15:13</sup>But if there is not a resurrection of the dead,
Christ has not been raised; <sup class="v">15:14</sup>and if Christ
has not been raised, then both our preaching is vain, and your
faith also vain; <sup class="v">15:15</sup>and we are found also
false witnesses of God, because we testified in regard to God that
he raised up Christ, whom he raised not up if indeed the dead are
not raised. <sup class="v">15:16</sup>For if the dead are not
raised, Christ was not raised; <sup class="v">15:17</sup>and if
Christ was not raised, your faith is vain, you are yet in your
sins, <sup class="v">15:18</sup>and those then who have fallen
asleep in Christ have perished. <sup class="v">15:19</sup>If in
this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most
miserable.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">15:20</sup>But now Christ has
been raised from the dead, a first fruit of those that have slept.
<sup class="v">15:21</sup>For since by a man came death, by a man
also came the resurrection of the dead. <sup class=
"v">15:22</sup>For as in Adam all die, so in Christ also shall all
be made alive. <sup class="v">15:23</sup>But each one in his own
order; Christ a first fruit, then those who are Christ's at his
coming; <sup class="v">15:24</sup>then is the end, when he delivers
up the kingdom to the God and Father, when he will destroy every
principality and every authority and power. <sup class=
"v">15:25</sup>For he must reign till he has put all enemies under
his feet. <sup class="v">15:26</sup>The last enemy, death, shall be
destroyed, <sup class="v">15:27</sup>for he put all things under
his feet. But when he says that all things are put under him, it is
clear that he is excepted who puts all things under him;
<sup class="v">15:28</sup>and when all things have been put under
him, then will the Son also himself be subject to him that put all
things under him, that God may be all in all.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">15:29</sup>Else what will they do
who are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? and why
are they baptized for them? <sup class="v">15:30</sup>Why also do
we encounter danger every hour? <sup class="v">15:31</sup>By the
joy on account of you which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die
daily. <sup class="v">15:32</sup>If after the manner of men I have
fought with beasts at Ephesus, of what advantage is it to me? If
the dead rise not, let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.
<sup class="v">15:33</sup>Be not deceived; evil companionships
corrupt good morals. <sup class="v">15:34</sup>Awake to
righteousness and sin not; for some have not a knowledge of God. I
speak to your shame.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">15:35</sup>But some one will say,
How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?
<sup class="v">15:36</sup>Foolish man, what you sow is not made
alive unless it dies; <sup class="v">15:37</sup>and what you sow,
you sow not the body which shall be, but the naked grain, it may be
of wheat, or some of the other grains; <sup class=
"v">15:38</sup>but God gives it a body as he pleases, and to each
of the grains its own body. <sup class="v">15:39</sup>All flesh is
not the same flesh; but there is one flesh of men, and another
flesh of beasts, and another flesh of birds, and another of fishes.
<sup class="v">15:40</sup>And there are heavenly bodies and earthly
bodies; but the glory of the heavenly is one, and of the earthly
another. <sup class="v">15:41</sup>There is one glory of the sun,
and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for
star differs from star in glory. <sup class="v">15:42</sup>So also
is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in destruction, it is
raised in indestructibleness; <sup class="v">15:43</sup>it is sown
in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is
raised in power; <sup class="v">15:44</sup>it is sown a natural
body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body,
there is also a spiritual body. <sup class="v">15:45</sup>And thus
it is written; The first man Adam became a living soul; the last
Adam is a life-giving spirit. <sup class="v">15:46</sup>But the
spiritual was not first, but the natural; then the spiritual.
<sup class="v">15:47</sup>The first man was from the earth,
earthly, the second man is from heaven. <sup class=
"v">15:48</sup>Like the earthly, such also are the earthly; and
like the heavenly, such also are the heavenly; <sup class=
"v">15:49</sup>and as we have borne the image of the earthly, we
shall also bear the image of the heavenly.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">15:50</sup>But I say this,
brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God,
nor shall destruction inherit indestructibleness. <sup class=
"v">15:51</sup>Behold, I tell you a mystery; we shall not all
sleep, but we shall all be changed, <sup class="v">15:52</sup>in a
moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet; for the
trumpet shall sound, and the dead be raised, indestructible, and we
shall be changed. <sup class="v">15:53</sup>For this destructible
must put on indestructibleness, and this mortal must put on
immortality. <sup class="v">15:54</sup>And when this destructible
has put on indestructibleness, and this mortal has put on
immortality, then shall the word be accomplished that is written;
Death was swallowed up in victory. <sup class="v">15:55</sup>Where,
death, is your sting? where, death, is your victory? <sup class=
"v">15:56</sup>And the sting of death is sin, and the power of sin
is the law; <sup class="v">15:57</sup>but thanks be to God who
gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. <sup class=
"v">15:58</sup>Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast,
immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that
your labor is not in vain in the Lord.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<h3>CHARITABLE COLLECTIONS, TIMOTHY, APOLLOS, FAMILY OF STEPHANAS,
SALUTATIONS.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">16:1</sup>CONCERNING the
collection for the saints, as I directed the churches of Galatia,
so also do you. <sup class="v">16:2</sup>On the first day of the
week let each one of you lay aside by himself in store as God has
prospered him, that there may be no collections made when I come.
<sup class="v">16:3</sup>And when I come, whom you shall approve,
these will I send with letters to carry your charity to Jerusalem;
<sup class="v">16:4</sup>and if it seems best that I should go,
they shall go with me. <sup class="v">16:5</sup>And I will come to
you when I pass through Macedonia; for I will pass through
Macedonia <sup class="v">16:6</sup>and perhaps remain and spend the
winter, that you may send me forward wherever I go. <sup class=
"v">16:7</sup>For I do not wish now to see you by the way; for I
hope to continue some time with you, if the Lord permits.
<sup class="v">16:8</sup>But I will remain at Ephesus till
Pentecost, <sup class="v">16:9</sup>for a great and effectual door
is opened to me, and there are many adversaries.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">16:10</sup>If Timothy comes, see
that he is with you without fear, for he performs the work of the
Lord, as I also do; <sup class="v">16:11</sup>let no one therefore
despise him. But send him forward in peace, that he may come to me;
for I look for him with the brothers.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">16:12</sup>But concerning Apollos
the brother, I have exhorted him much to come to you with the
brothers; but he was entirely indisposed to come now, but he will
come when he has a convenient time.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">16:13</sup>Be watchful, stand
firm in the faith, be manly, be strong, <sup class=
"v">16:14</sup>let all your [works] be in love.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">16:15</sup>And I exhort you,
brothers, know the family of Stephanas, for it is a first fruit of
Achaia, and they devoted themselves to serving the saints;
<sup class="v">16:16</sup>that you also be in subjection to such,
and to every one that works and labors with us. <sup class=
"v">16:17</sup>I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus
and Achaiacus, for they supplied your lack, <sup class=
"v">16:18</sup>and refreshed my spirit and yours. Know therefore
such.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">16:19</sup>The churches of Asia
salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with
the assembly [church] at their house. <sup class="v">16:20</sup>All
the brothers salute you. Salute one another with a holy kiss.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">16:21</sup>The salutation with my
hand, Paul's. <sup class="v">16:22</sup>If any one is not a friend
to the Lord, let him be accursed. The Lord comes. <sup class=
"v">16:23</sup>The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you. <sup class=
"v">16:24</sup>My love be with you all in Christ Jesus.</p>
<h1 style="margin-top:6em; margin-bottom:1em"><A name="b47">SECOND EPISTLE TO THE
 CORINTHIANS.</A></h1>
<h3>PHILIPPI, A.D. 58. (ACTS, 16:1.)</h3>
<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>
<h3>THE APOSTLE'S LOVE OF THE CORINTHIANS, HIS TRIALS, HIS DESIGN
TO VISIT THEM, HIS FORMER LETTER, ETC.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">1:1</sup>PAUL, an apostle of
Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy the brother, to the
church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints who are in
all Achaia. <sup class="v">1:2</sup>Grace be to you, and peace from
God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">1:3</sup>Blessed be the God and
lather of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of
all comfort, <sup class="v">1:4</sup>who comforts us in all our
affliction, that we may be able to comfort those in every
affliction with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted
by God, <sup class="v">1:5</sup>because as Christ's sufferings
abound in us, so also through Christ does our comfort abound.
<sup class="v">1:6</sup>And if we are afflicted, it is for your
comfort and salvation, wrought by a patient endurance the same
sufferings which we also suffer, and our hope for you is strong;
and if we are comforted, it is for your comfort and salvation,
<sup class="v">1:7</sup>knowing that as you are partakers of the
sufferings, so you are also of the comfort.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">1:8</sup>For we wish you not to
be ignorant, brothers, of our affliction which befell us in Asia,
that we were exceedingly oppressed beyond our power, so that we
despaired even of life; <sup class="v">1:9</sup>but we had the
sentence of death in ourselves, that we might not trust in
ourselves, but in God who raises the dead, <sup class=
"v">1:10</sup>who delivered us from so great a death and will
deliver, in whom we hope that he will also still deliver,
<sup class="v">1:11</sup>you also striving together for us in
prayer, that thanks may be rendered for us by many persons for the
gift bestowed on us by many.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">1:12</sup>For this is our
rejoicing; the testimony of our conscience that in purity and godly
sincerity, not with a carnal wisdom, but with a divine grace, we
have conducted ourselves in the world, and most abundantly towards
you. <sup class="v">1:13</sup>For we do not write to you of other
things, but of what you read and acknowledge; and I hope you will
also acknowledge to the end, <sup class="v">1:14</sup>as you have
also acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing as you
also are ours in the day of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">1:15</sup>And in this confidence
I wished to come to you before, that you might have a second
benefit, <sup class="v">1:16</sup>and to pass by you into
Macedonia, and to come again from Macedonia to you, and by you to
be sent forward to Judea. <sup class="v">1:17</sup>Wishing this
therefore, did I use lightness? or what I wish do I wish according
to the flesh, that with me there may be the yes, yes, and the no,
no? <sup class="v">1:18</sup>But as God is faithful, our word to
you was not yes and no. <sup class="v">1:19</sup>For Jesus Christ,
the Son of God, who was preached among you by us, by me and
Silvanus and Timothy, was not yes and no, but was yes in him;
<sup class="v">1:20</sup>for all the promises of God, the yes in
him, and the Amen in him, are for glory to God by us. <sup class=
"v">1:21</sup>And he that establishes us with you in Christ, and
has anointed us, is God, <sup class="v">1:22</sup>who has also
sealed us and given us the pledge of the Spirit in our hearts.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">1:23</sup>But I call God to
witness on my soul, that to spare you I have not yet come to
Corinth. <sup class="v">1:24</sup>Not that we are lords of your
faith, but co-laborers of your joy; for you stand firm by the
faith. <sup class="v">2:1</sup>But I determined this with myself,
not to come again to you in sorrow; <sup class="v">2:2</sup>for if
I grieve you, who is he that gladdens me, but he that is grieved by
me? <sup class="v">2:3</sup>And I wrote the same to you that coming
I might not have sorrow for those in whom I ought to have joy,
having trusted in you all that my joy is the joy of you all.
<sup class="v">2:4</sup>For I wrote to you in much affliction and
distress of mind with many tears, not that you should be grieved,
but that you might know the love which I have abundantly for
you.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">2:5</sup>But if any one has
caused grief, he has not grieved me, but in part, that I may not be
hard upon you, [has grieved you] all, <sup class=
"v">2:6</sup>Sufficient for such a one is this rebuke by many;
<sup class="v">2:7</sup>so that on the other hand you ought to
forgive and comfort him, that he may not be overwhelmed with
excessive sorrow. <sup class="v">2:8</sup>I exhort you, therefore,
to confirm your love to him; <sup class="v">2:9</sup>for I wrote
for this purpose, that I might know the proof of you, whether you
are obedient in all things. <sup class="v">2:10</sup>But whom you
favor I also will favor; for what favor I have shown, if I have
shown any favor, has been for your sakes, in the presence of
Christ, <sup class="v">2:11</sup>that we may not be circumvented by
Satan; for we are not ignorant of his devices.</p>
<p class="pin">8 <sup class="v">2:12</sup>But when I came to
Troas for the gospel of Christ, and a door was opened to me by the
Lord, <sup class="v">2:13</sup>I had no rest in my spirit from not
finding Titus my brother; but leaving them I went to Macedonia.
<sup class="v">2:14</sup>But thanks be to God, who always triumphs
over us in Christ and reveals the odor of his knowledge by us in
every place; <sup class="v">2:15</sup>for we are a sweet odor of
Christ to God, in the saved and in the lost, <sup class=
"v">2:16</sup>in one an odor of death to death, and in the other an
odor of life to life. And who is sufficient for these things?
<sup class="v">2:17</sup>For we are not as many, who adulterate the
word of God, [for gain]; but as of sincerity, but as of God, we
speak before God in Christ.</p>
<p class="pin">9 <sup class="v">3:1</sup>Do we begin again to
commend ourselves? or need we, as some, commendatory epistles to
you or from you? <sup class="v">3:2</sup>You are our epistle,
written by our hearts, known and read by all men, <sup class=
"v">3:3</sup>for you are manifestly an epistle of Christ delivered
by us, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God,
not on tablets of stone but on tablets of hearts of flesh.
<sup class="v">3:4</sup>And we have such confidence through Jesus
Christ in God; <sup class="v">3:5</sup>not that we are sufficient
of ourselves to reason out any thing as of ourselves, but our
sufficiency is of God, <sup class="v">3:6</sup>who also has made us
able ministers of the new covenant, not of the writing but of the
spirit; for the writing kills, but the spirit makes alive.</p>
<p class="pin">10 <sup class="v">3:7</sup>But if the ministry of
death engraved in a writing on stones was glorious, so that the
children of Israel could not look steadily at the face of Moses on
account of the brightness of his face, which passed away,
<sup class="v">3:8</sup>how shall not the ministry of the spirit be
glorious? <sup class="v">3:9</sup>For if the ministry of
condemnation was a glory, much more will the ministry of
righteousness abound in glory. <sup class="v">3:10</sup>For that
which was made glorious was not glorious in this respect, on
account of the surpassing glory. <sup class="v">3:11</sup>For if
that which has passed away was with glory, much more will that
which continues be in glory.</p>
<p class="pin">11 <sup class="v">3:12</sup>Having therefore this
hope we use great boldness, <sup class="v">3:13</sup>and not as
Moses put a vail on his face, that the children of Israel might not
see to the end of that which has passed away; <sup class=
"v">3:14</sup>but their minds were blinded. For to this day in
reading the old covenant the same vail remains, not taken away
because it is taken away in Christ; <sup class="v">3:15</sup>but to
this day when Moses is read a vail lies upon their minds;
<sup class="v">3:16</sup>but when they turn to the Lord the vail is
taken away. <sup class="v">3:17</sup>And the Lord is the Spirit;
and where the Spirit of the Lord is there is liberty. <sup class=
"v">3:18</sup>And we all with unvailed face beholding as in a glass
the glory of the Lord, are transformed into the same likeness, from
glory to glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord.</p>
<p class="pin">12 <sup class="v">4:1</sup>Therefore, having this
ministry, as we have obtained mercy we faint not, <sup class=
"v">4:2</sup>but have renounced the hidden things of shame, not
walking in craftiness nor handling the word of God deceitfully, but
commending ourselves by the manifestation of the truth to every
conscience of men before God. <sup class="v">4:3</sup>But if our
gospel is vailed it is vailed among the lost, <sup class=
"v">4:4</sup>in whom the god of this life has blinded the minds of
the unbelieving, that the light of the gospel of the glory of
Christ, who is the likeness of God, may not shine. <sup class=
"v">4:5</sup>For we preach not ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord,
and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake. <sup class=
"v">4:6</sup>For God who commanded the light to shine out of
darkness, has shone in our hearts to give us the light of the
knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="pin">13 <sup class="v">4:7</sup>But we have this
treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may
be of God and not of us, <sup class="v">4:8</sup>being afflicted in
every thing but not distressed, being perplexed but not in despair,
<sup class="v">4:9</sup>being persecuted but not deserted, being
cast down but not destroyed, <sup class="v">4:10</sup>always
carrying about the death of Jesus in the body, that the life of
Jesus may also be manifested in our bodies. <sup class=
"v">4:11</sup>For we who live are always delivered to death for
Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus may be made manifest in
our mortal flesh. <sup class="v">4:12</sup>So that death works in
us, but life in you. <sup class="v">4:13</sup>And having the same
spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, therefore
I spoke, we also believe and therefore speak, <sup class=
"v">4:14</sup>knowing that he who raised up the Lord Jesus will
also raise us up with Jesus, and present us with you. <sup class=
"v">4:15</sup>For all things are for your sakes, that the abundant
grace may abound through the thanksgiving of many to the glory of
God.</p>
<p class="pin">14 <sup class="v">4:16</sup>Wherefore we faint
not, but if our outward man is destroyed our inward man is renewed
day by day. <sup class="v">4:17</sup>For the light affliction which
is for a moment, works out for us more abundantly an eternal weight
of glory, <sup class="v">4:18</sup>while we look not on the things
which are seen but on the things which are not seen; for the things
which are seen are for a time, but those which are unseen are
eternal.</p>
<p class="pin">15 <sup class="v">5:1</sup>For we know that if our
earthly house of this tabernacle was destroyed, we have an edifice
from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.
<sup class="v">5:2</sup>For in this we also groan, earnestly
desiring to put on our dwelling which is from heaven, <sup class=
"v">5:3</sup>if indeed also having put it on we may not be found
naked. <sup class="v">5:4</sup>For being in this tabernacle we
groan, being burdened, because we do not wish to put it off, but to
put on [the other], that the mortal may be swallowed up by life.
<sup class="v">5:5</sup>And he that has made us for this is God,
who has given us the pledge of the Spirit. <sup class=
"v">5:6</sup>Being always confident therefore, and knowing that
while we are present in the body we are absent from the
Lord,&mdash; <sup class="v">5:7</sup>we walk by faith, not by
sight;&mdash; <sup class="v">5:8</sup>but we are confident, and are
pleased rather to be absent from the body and to be present with
the Lord. <sup class="v">5:9</sup>Wherefore also we strive, whether
present or absent, to be well pleasing to him. <sup class=
"v">5:10</sup>For we must all appear before the tribunal of Christ,
that each one may receive through the body for what he has done,
whether it is good or evil.</p>
<p class="pin">16 <sup class="v">5:11</sup>Knowing therefore the
fear of the Lord we persuade men, but are made manifest to God; and
I hope also to be made manifest in your consciences. <sup class=
"v">5:12</sup>For we do not again commend ourselves to you, but
give you occasion to glory on our account, that you may have
something for those that glory in appearance and not in heart.
<sup class="v">5:13</sup>For if we are beside ourselves it is for
God; and if we are sober it is for you. <sup class=
"v">5:14</sup>For the love of Christ constrains us, judging this,
that if one died for all then were all dead; <sup class=
"v">5:15</sup>and he died for all, that those who live should no
more live for themselves but for him that died for them and rose
again. <sup class="v">5:16</sup>So that from henceforth we know no
man after the flesh; and if we have known Christ after the flesh,
we now know him no more. <sup class="v">5:17</sup>So that if any
one is in Christ he is a new creation; old things have passed away,
behold, all things have become new. <sup class="v">5:18</sup>And
all things are of God, who has reconciled us to himself by Jesus
Christ, and given us the ministry of the reconciliation,
<sup class="v">5:19</sup>to wit, that God was in Christ reconciling
the world to himself, not imputing to them their offenses, and has
given to us the word of reconciliation. <sup class="v">5:20</sup>We
are embassadors therefore for Christ, as though God besought you by
us; we pray you, for Christ, be reconciled to God. <sup class=
"v">5:21</sup>For he made him who knew no sin to be sin for us,
that we might become God's righteousness in him.</p>
<p class="pin">17 <sup class="v">6:1</sup>And being also
co-laborers we exhort you not to receive the grace of God in
vain,&mdash; <sup class="v">6:2</sup>for he says, In an acceptable
time I heard you, and in a day of salvation I helped you; behold,
now is an acceptable time, behold, now is a day of
salvation,&mdash; <sup class="v">6:3</sup>giving no offense in any
thing, that the ministry may not be blamed, <sup class=
"v">6:4</sup>but in every thing commending ourselves as ministers
of God, in great patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in
distresses, <sup class="v">6:5</sup>in stripes, in imprisonments,
in dissensions, in labors, in watchings, in fastings, <sup class=
"v">6:6</sup>in purity, in knowledge, in long-suffering, in
kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in love unfeigned, <sup class=
"v">6:7</sup>in the word of truth, in the power of God; with the
arms of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,
<sup class="v">6:8</sup>with honor and dishonor, with evil report
and good report; as deceivers and true, <sup class="v">6:9</sup>as
unknown and well-known, as dying and behold we live, as chastened
and not killed, <sup class="v">6:10</sup>as grieving but always
rejoicing, as poor but making many rich, as having nothing and
possessing all things.</p>
<p class="pin">18 <sup class="v">6:11</sup>Our mouth is opened to
you, Corinthians, our heart is enlarged; <sup class=
"v">6:12</sup>you are not straitened in us, but you are straitened
in your own souls; <sup class="v">6:13</sup>and now as a return of
benefits, I speak as to children, do you also be enlarged.</p>
<p class="pin">19 <sup class="v">6:14</sup>Be not unequally yoked
with unbelievers; for what participation has righteousness with
wickedness? or what communion has light with darkness? <sup class=
"v">6:15</sup>and what agreement has Christ with Beliar, or what
part has a believer with an unbeliever? <sup class=
"v">6:16</sup>and what agreement has a temple of God with idols?
For you are a temple of the living God; as God said, I will dwell
in them, and I will walk in them, and I will be to them a God and
they shall be to me a people. <sup class="v">6:17</sup>Go out
therefore from among them, and be separate, says the Lord, and
touch not the impure; and I will receive you, <sup class=
"v">6:18</sup>and will be to you a father, and you shall be to me
sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty. <sup class=
"v">7:1</sup>Having therefore these promises, beloved, let us
purify ourselves from every defilement of the flesh and spirit,
perfecting holiness in the fear of God.</p>
<p class="pin">20 <sup class="v">7:2</sup>Receive us; we have
injured no one, we have destroyed no one, we have defrauded no one.
<sup class="v">7:3</sup>I say this not to condemn you, for I have
said before that you are in our hearts both to die and live
together. <sup class="v">7:4</sup>I have great boldness towards
you, and great glorying on your account; I am full of comfort, I
have a super-abounding joy in all our afflictions. <sup class=
"v">7:5</sup>For when we came into Macedonia our flesh had no rest,
but we were distressed on every hand; without were conflicts,
within fears; <sup class="v">7:6</sup>but God who comforts the
humble comforted us by the coming of Titus; <sup class=
"v">7:7</sup>and not only by his coming but also by the comfort
with which he was comforted on your account, telling us of your
great desire, your deep sorrow, your zeal for me, so that I rather
rejoiced. <sup class="v">7:8</sup>For if I even grieved you by the
epistle, I do not repent, though I did repent; for because I see
that the epistle grieved you but for a time, <sup class=
"v">7:9</sup>now I rejoice, not that you were grieved, but that you
grieved to a change of mind; for you were grieved in a godly
manner, to suffer injury from us in nothing. <sup class=
"v">7:10</sup>For godly sorrow produces a change of mind to
salvation not to be repented of; but the sorrow of the world
produces death. <sup class="v">7:11</sup>For behold, this same
thing, that you grieved in a godly manner, how great diligence it
produced in you, what a defense, what indignation, what fear, what
desire, what zeal, what a punishment! In every thing you proved
yourselves to be clear in this matter.</p>
<p class="pin">21 <sup class="v">7:12</sup>If therefore I wrote
to you, it was not on account of him that did the wrong, nor on
account of him that suffered wrong, but that our diligence in your
behalf might be manifest before God. <sup class="v">7:13</sup>On
this account we were comforted. And in addition to our comfort, we
rejoiced more abundantly for the joy of Titus, because his spirit
was refreshed by you all; <sup class="v">7:14</sup>for if I had
boasted of you to him I was not ashamed, but as we said all things
to you in truth, so also the boasting of you to Titus was truth.
<sup class="v">7:15</sup>And his affection is more abundant for
you, remembering the obedience of you all, how with fear and
trembling you received him. <sup class="v">7:16</sup>I rejoice that
I have confidence in you in every thing.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<h3>A CONTRIBUTION SOLICITED FOR THE SAINTS AT JERUSALEM.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">8:1</sup>AND I make known to you,
brothers, the grace of God given to the churches of Macedonia,
<sup class="v">8:2</sup>that in much trying affliction the
abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded to the
riches of their liberality. <sup class="v">8:3</sup>For according
to their ability, I testify, and beyond their ability, of their own
accord, <sup class="v">8:4</sup>with much entreaty they desired of
us the favor of a participation in the service to the saints;
<sup class="v">8:5</sup>and not as we hoped, but they first gave
themselves to the Lord and to us by the will of God, <sup class=
"v">8:6</sup>so that we requested Titus, as he before began, that
he would complete also this charity with you. <sup class=
"v">8:7</sup>But as you abound in every thing, in faith, and
speech, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love for
us, [we desire] that you may abound in this grace also.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">8:8</sup>I do not speak by
command, but on account of the diligence of others, and to prove
the genuineness of your love; <sup class="v">8:9</sup>for you know
the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that for your sakes he became
poor, though rich, that you by his poverty might be rich.
<sup class="v">8:10</sup>And in this case I give an opinion; for
this is expedient for you, who began before to act in this matter
and to act willingly a year ago. <sup class="v">8:11</sup>And now,
therefore, perform the doing also, that as there was a readiness to
will, so also there may be a performance from what you have.
<sup class="v">8:12</sup>For if there is a willing mind, a man is
acceptable according to what he has, and not according to what he
has not. <sup class="v">8:13</sup>Not that others may be relieved
and you burdened, <sup class="v">8:14</sup>but that there may be an
equality; that at the present time your abundance may supply their
deficiency, and that their abundance may supply your deficiency,
that there may be an equality, <sup class="v">8:15</sup>as it is
written; He that [gathered] much had nothing over, and he that
[gathered] little had no deficiency.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">8:16</sup>But thanks be to God,
who put this care for you into the heart of Titus, <sup class=
"v">8:17</sup>for he received the exhortation, and being extremely
diligent went to you of his own accord. <sup class=
"v">8:18</sup>And we sent with him the brother, whose praise in the
gospel is in all the churches, <sup class="v">8:19</sup>and not
only so, but he has also been chosen by the churches as our
travelling companion in this charity ministered by us for the glory
of the same Lord and our promptitude, <sup class=
"v">8:20</sup>guarding against this, that no one may blame us in
this abundance administered by us; <sup class="v">8:21</sup>for we
provide things honorable not only before the Lord, but also before
men. <sup class="v">8:22</sup>And we have sent with them our
brother, whom we have often proved in many services to be diligent,
and who is now much more diligent from the great confidence in you.
<sup class="v">8:23</sup>If [any one inquires] respecting Titus, he
is my companion and co-laborer for you; if our brothers, they are
apostles of churches and the glory of Christ. <sup class=
"v">8:24</sup>Show them therefore the proof of your love, and of
our boasting of you before the churches.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">9:1</sup>For concerning the
service for the saints it is superfluous for me to write to you;
<sup class="v">9:2</sup>for I know your readiness, of which I
boasted in your behalf to the Macedonians that Achaia was ready a
year ago, and your zeal has excited many. <sup class=
"v">9:3</sup>But I sent the brothers, that our boasting of you may
not be in vain in this respect, as I said you were prepared,
<sup class="v">9:4</sup>lest if the Macedonians should come with me
and find you unprepared, we, not to say you, should be ashamed of
this confidence. <sup class="v">9:5</sup>I thought it necessary,
therefore, to exhort the brothers to go to you before, and to make
ready your free gift before announced, that it may be ready as a
free gift and not as an exaction.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">9:6</sup>And [consider] this, He
that sows sparingly shall reap also sparingly, and he that sows
liberally shall reap also liberally. <sup class="v">9:7</sup>Let
each one contribute as he chooses in his heart, not with regret or
from necessity; for God loves a cheerful giver. <sup class=
"v">9:8</sup>And God is able to make every favor abound to you,
that having always every sufficiency in every thing you may abound
in every good work; <sup class="v">9:9</sup>as it is written, He
scattered abroad, he gave to the poor, his righteousness continues
forever. <sup class="v">9:10</sup>And may he that supplies seed to
the sower and bread for eating multiply your grain, and increase
the products of your righteousness; <sup class="v">9:11</sup>that
you may be enriched in every thing for all liberality, which
produces through us thanksgiving to God. <sup class=
"v">9:12</sup>For the performance of this service not only supplies
the need of the saints, but also abounds with the thanksgivings of
many to God; <sup class="v">9:13</sup>[they] glorifying God on
account of the proof of this ministry for your professed subjection
to the gospel of Christ and the liberality of the contribution to
them and to all, <sup class="v">9:14</sup>and by their prayer for
you, greatly longing for you on account of the abounding grace of
God upon you. <sup class="v">9:15</sup>Thanks be to God for his
unspeakable gift.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<h3>PAUL'S REPLY TO HIS DETRACTORS.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">10:1</sup>I PAUL also exhort you
by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in appearance am
humble among you, but being absent am bold towards you; <sup class=
"v">10:2</sup>and I desire that I may not be bold when present,
with that confidence which I design to use against some who speak
of us as if we walked according to the flesh. <sup class=
"v">10:3</sup>For though we walk in the flesh we do not war
according to the flesh, <sup class="v">10:4</sup>for the arms of
our warfare are not of flesh, but mighty with God to the pulling
down of strongholds, <sup class="v">10:5</sup>destroying [false]
reasonings and every height which is exalted against the knowledge
of God, and subjecting every thought to the obedience of Christ,
<sup class="v">10:6</sup>and being ready to punish every
disobedience, when your obedience is completed.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">10:7</sup>You see things
according to appearances. If any one trusts in himself that he is
Christ's, let him consider again with himself that as he is
Christ's so also are we. <sup class="v">10:8</sup>For if I should
even boast some of our authority which the Lord gave for your
edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed.
<sup class="v">10:9</sup>[But I forbear,] that I may not seem as
though I would terrify you by epistles. <sup class=
"v">10:10</sup>For the epistles, say they, are weighty and
powerful, but the bodily presence is weak and speech contemptible.
<sup class="v">10:11</sup>Let such a one think, that such as we are
in word by epistles when absent, such also will we be in work when
present. <sup class="v">10:12</sup>For we dare not judge or compare
ourselves with some who commend themselves; but they, measuring
themselves with themselves, and comparing themselves with
themselves, are not wise. <sup class="v">10:13</sup>But we will not
boast of things not measured, but according to the measure of the
rule which God has given us, to come even to you. <sup class=
"v">10:14</sup>For we do not stretch ourselves out too far, as if
we had not come to you, for we came even to you with the gospel of
Christ; <sup class="v">10:15</sup>not boasting of things unmeasured
in the labors of others, but having a hope, your faith being
increased, that we shall be magnified among you according to our
rule abundantly, <sup class="v">10:16</sup>to preach the gospel in
the parts beyond you, not to boast of things prepared by another's
rule. <sup class="v">10:17</sup>But let him that glories glory in
the Lord; <sup class="v">10:18</sup>for not he that commends
himself is approved, but he whom the Lord commends.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">11:1</sup>I wish you would bear a
little with my folly; and indeed do bear with me. <sup class=
"v">11:2</sup>For I am zealous for you with a godly zeal, for I
joined you, a chaste virgin, to one husband, to present to Christ;
<sup class="v">11:3</sup>but I fear lest as the serpent deceived
Eve with his craftiness, so also your minds may be corrupted from
the simplicity which is in Christ. <sup class="v">11:4</sup>For if
he that comes preaches another Jesus whom we did not preach, or you
receive another spirit which you did not receive, or another gospel
which you did not receive, you might well bear it; <sup class=
"v">11:5</sup>for I judge that I am not behind the chief of the
apostles. <sup class="v">11:6</sup>And even if I am rude in speech,
I certainly am not in knowledge, but we have been made fully
manifest to you in all things. <sup class="v">11:7</sup>Have I done
wrong to humble myself that you might be exalted, that I preached
the gospel of God to you gratuitously? <sup class="v">11:8</sup>I
robbed other churches taking wages to serve you; <sup class=
"v">11:9</sup>and when I was with you and was in want, I was
burdensome to no one; for the brothers who came from Macedonia
supplied beforehand my need; and in every thing I kept myself
without being burdensome to you, and will keep myself so.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">11:10</sup>As the truth of Christ
is in me, this boasting in respect to myself shall not be silenced
in the regions of Achaia. <sup class="v">11:11</sup>Why? Because I
love you not? God knows. <sup class="v">11:12</sup>But what I do I
also will do, that I may take away an occasion from those who wish
an occasion, that wherein they boast they may be found even as we
are. <sup class="v">11:13</sup>For such false apostles, deceitful
laborers, transform themselves into apostles of Christ. <sup class=
"v">11:14</sup>And no wonder; for Satan himself transforms himself
into an angel of light. <sup class="v">11:15</sup>It is no great
thing, therefore, if his ministers transform themselves as
ministers of righteousness, whose end will be according to their
works.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">11:16</sup>Again, I say let no
one think me to be foolish; but if otherwise, even as a foolish man
bear with me that I may boast a little. <sup class=
"v">11:17</sup>What I say, I do not say according to the Lord, but
as it were in foolishness, in this confidence of boasting.
<sup class="v">11:18</sup>Since many boast of the flesh, I also
will boast. <sup class="v">11:19</sup>You endure fools patiently
being wise; <sup class="v">11:20</sup>for you endure it if any one
reduces you to servitude, if any one devours you, if any one takes
from you, if any one exalts himself against you, if any one beats
you in the face.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">11:21</sup>I speak of reproach as
if we were weak; wherein any one is bold, I speak foolishly, I am
bold also. <sup class="v">11:22</sup>Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are
they Israelites? so am I. Are they the posterity of Abraham? so am
I. <sup class="v">11:23</sup>Are they ministers of Christ? I speak
foolishly, I am more; in labors most abundant, in stripes above
measure, in imprisonments most abundant, in deaths often;
<sup class="v">11:24</sup>five times I received of the Jews forty
[stripes] lacking one, <sup class="v">11:25</sup>thrice was I
beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice have I been
shipwrecked, a night and a day have I spent in the deep;
<sup class="v">11:26</sup>often on journeys, in dangers from
rivers, in dangers from robbers, in dangers from [my own] race, in
dangers from gentiles, in dangers in the city, in dangers in the
wilderness, in dangers on the sea, in dangers among false brothers,
<sup class="v">11:27</sup>in labor and weariness, in watchings
often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and
nakedness. <sup class="v">11:28</sup>Besides things without, that
which comes upon me daily, the care of all the churches.
<sup class="v">11:29</sup>Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is
offended, and I am not displeased? <sup class="v">11:30</sup>If it
is necessary to boast, I will boast of my infirmities. <sup class=
"v">11:31</sup>The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is
blessed forever, knows that I lie not. <sup class="v">11:32</sup>In
Damascus, the ethnarch, when Aretas was king, guarded the city of
the Damascenes, desiring to take me, <sup class="v">11:33</sup>and
I was let down in a rope-basket, by a window in the wall, and
escaped from his hands.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">12:1</sup>It is not expedient
therefore for me to boast [of these things]; for I will come to
visions and revelations of the Lord. <sup class="v">12:2</sup>I
know a man, in Christ above fourteen years, whether in the body I
know not, or out of the body I know not, God knows,&mdash;such a
one caught up to the third heaven. <sup class="v">12:3</sup>I know
even such a man,&mdash;whether in the body or out of the body I
know not, God knows,&mdash; <sup class="v">12:4</sup>that he was
caught up to paradise, and heard unutterable words, which it is not
lawful for man to speak. <sup class="v">12:5</sup>Of such a one
will I boast, but of myself I will not boast except of my
infirmities. <sup class="v">12:6</sup>For if I shall wish to boast
I shall not be foolish, for I will tell the truth. But I forbear,
lest any one should think of me beyond what he sees or hears of
me.</p>
<p class="pin">8 <sup class="v">12:7</sup>And that I might not be
elated with my extraordinary revelations, there was given me a
thorn in the flesh, an angel of Satan to beat me, that I should not
be too much exalted. <sup class="v">12:8</sup>For this I besought
the Lord thrice that it might leave me. <sup class=
"v">12:9</sup>And he said to me, My grace is sufficient for you;
for power is perfected in weakness. <sup class="v">12:10</sup>Most
gladly, therefore, will I glory in my infirmities, that the power
of Christ may rest upon me. Wherefore I am well pleased with
infirmities, with injuries, with necessities, with persecutions,
with distresses for Christ; for when I am weak, then am I
strong.</p>
<p class="pin">9 <sup class="v">12:11</sup>I have become foolish;
you compelled me. For I ought to have been commended by you; for in
nothing am I behind the chief of the apostles, though I also am
nothing. <sup class="v">12:12</sup>The signs of an apostle were
performed among you with all patience, in miracles, and prodigies,
and mighty works. <sup class="v">12:13</sup>For what is there in
which you were inferior to the rest of the churches, except that I
was not burdensome to you? Forgive me this wrong.</p>
<p class="pin">10 <sup class="v">12:14</sup>Behold, I am ready to
come to you a third time, and I will not be burdensome to you; for
I seek not yours, but you. For the children ought not to lay up
treasure for the parents, but the parents for the children.
<sup class="v">12:15</sup>And I most gladly will spend and will be
spent for your souls, even if the more abundantly I love you the
less I am loved. <sup class="v">12:16</sup>Be it so, I was not
burdensome to you; but being crafty I caught you with deceit.
<sup class="v">12:17</sup>Did I make any thing out of you by any of
those I sent to you? <sup class="v">12:18</sup>I requested Titus,
and sent the brother with him; did Titus make any thing out of you?
Did we not walk in the same spirit, in the same steps?</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<h3>PROPOSED VISIT, ETC.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">12:19</sup>Do you again think
that we are defending ourselves? We speak in Christ before God; all
these things, beloved, are for your edification. <sup class=
"v">12:20</sup>For I fear lest when I come I shall not find you
such as I wish, and that I shall be found such as you wish not;
lest there shall be strife, envy, anger, contentions, evil
speakings, whisperings, pride, dissensions; <sup class=
"v">12:21</sup>lest when I come again my God shall humble me before
you, and I shall mourn for many who have sinned, and not changed
their minds, in respect to impurity and fornication and lewdness
which they have committed.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">13:1</sup>This third time I am
coming to you; by the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every
word be established. <sup class="v">13:2</sup>I have said before,
and I now foretell as if present a second time, although absent, to
those who have already sinned and to all the rest, that if I come
again I will not spare; <sup class="v">13:3</sup>since you seek a
proof in me of Christ speaking, who is not weak to you but powerful
in you; <sup class="v">13:4</sup>for though he was crucified in
weakness, yet he lives by the power of God; and we also are weak in
him, but live with him by the power of God in you.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">13:5</sup>Try yourselves, whether
you are in the faith; prove yourselves; or know you not yourselves
that Christ is in you unless you are reprobates? <sup class=
"v">13:6</sup>But I hope you will know that we are not reprobates.
<sup class="v">13:7</sup>We wish to God that you may do no evil,
not that we may appear approved, but that you may do good though we
should be as reprobates. <sup class="v">13:8</sup>For we can do
nothing against the truth, but for the truth. <sup class=
"v">13:9</sup>For we rejoice when we are weak and you are strong;
and we desire this, your perfection. <sup class="v">13:10</sup>For
this reason, being absent, I write these things, that I may not use
sharpness when present, with the power which the Lord has given me
for building up, and not for pulling down.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">13:11</sup>Finally, brothers,
rejoice, be perfect, be of good comfort, be of the same mind, live
in peace, and the God of love and peace shall be with you.
<sup class="v">13:12</sup>Salute one another with a holy kiss.
<sup class="v">13:13</sup>All the saints salute you. <sup class=
"v">13:14</sup>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of
God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.</p>

<h3>CORINTH, A.D., 58. (ACTS, 18:1)</h3>
<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>
<h3>HIMSELF, JESUS CHRIST, AND THE GOSPEL.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">1:1</sup>PAUL, a servant of
Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle, set apart to the gospel of
God,&mdash; <sup class="v">1:2</sup>which he promised by his
prophets in the Holy Scriptures,&mdash; <sup class=
"v">1:3</sup>concerning his Son born of the posterity of David as
to the flesh, <sup class="v">1:4</sup>declared to be the Son of God
in power as to the Spirit of holiness by the resurrection from the
dead,&mdash;Jesus Christ our Lord,&mdash; <sup class=
"v">1:5</sup>through whom we have received grace and an apostleship
for the obedience of the faith in all nations in behalf of his
name, <sup class="v">1:6</sup>among whom are you also the called of
Jesus Christ,&mdash; <sup class="v">1:7</sup>to all who are at
Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints. Grace be to you and
peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">1:8</sup>First, indeed, I thank
my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is
proclaimed in all the world. <sup class="v">1:9</sup>For God is my
witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, how
incessantly I make mention of you, always in my prayers <sup class=
"v">1:10</sup>asking if by any means I may now at some time have a
prosperous journey by the will of God to come to you. <sup class=
"v">1:11</sup>For I greatly desire to see you, that I may impart to
you some spiritual gift, that you may be strengthened, <sup class=
"v">1:12</sup>that is, that I may be comforted in you by the mutual
faith both of you and me.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">1:13</sup>But I wish you not to
be ignorant, brothers, that I often purposed to come to you, and
was hindered hitherto, that I might have some fruit also among you,
as among the other gentiles. <sup class="v">1:14</sup>I am a debtor
both to the Greeks and the Barbarians, both to the wise and the
ignorant; <sup class="v">1:15</sup>so that as far as depends upon
me I am ready also to preach the gospel to those at Rome.
<sup class="v">1:16</sup>For I am not ashamed of the gospel; for it
is the power of God to salvation to every one that believes, the
Jew first and also the Greek. <sup class="v">1:17</sup>For God's
righteousness is revealed in it by faith in the faith [the gospel];
as it is written; The righteous shall live by faith.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<h3>WICKEDNESS DESTROYS GENTILES AND JEWS.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">1:18</sup>FOR the wrath of God is
revealed from heaven against all impiety and wickedness of men who
hold the truth in wickedness, <sup class="v">1:19</sup>because what
can be known of God is manifest among them; for God has manifested
[himself] to them. <sup class="v">1:20</sup>For his invisible
[attributes] are clearly seen from the creation of the world, being
perceived by the things which are made, even his eternal power and
deity, so that they have no defense, <sup class=
"v">1:21</sup>because having known God they glorified him not as
God neither were thankful, but became vain in their reasonings and
their ignorant mind was darkened. <sup class="v">1:22</sup>Saying
that they were wise they became foolish, <sup class=
"v">1:23</sup>and changed the glory of the imperishable God into
the likeness of the image of perishable man, and of birds, and
quadrupeds, and reptiles.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">1:24</sup>Wherefore God also gave
them up with the desires of their hearts to impurity, to disgrace
their bodies among themselves, <sup class="v">1:25</sup>who changed
the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creation
more than the Creator, who is blessed forever, amen.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">1:26</sup>Therefore God gave them
up to infamous affections; for their females changed a natural
enjoyment for that which is against nature, <sup class=
"v">1:27</sup>and in like manner also the males, leaving the
natural enjoyment of the female, became the subjects of inordinate
desires for each other, males with males committing indecency, and
receiving in return the recompense of their error which was
fit.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">1:28</sup>And as they did not
choose to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them up to a
reprobate mind, to do things which are not proper, <sup class=
"v">1:29</sup>being filled with all wickedness, malice,
covetousness, vice, full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, evil
dispositions, whisperers, <sup class="v">1:30</sup>evil speakers,
haters of God, injurious, proud, boasters, inventors of evil
things, disobedient to parents, <sup class=
"v">1:31</sup>unintelligent, covenant-breakers, without natural
affection, unmerciful, <sup class="v">1:32</sup>who knowing the
ordinance of God, that those who do such things deserve death, not
only do the same, but have pleasure in those who do them.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">2:1</sup>Wherefore you are
inexcusable, O man, whoever you are that judge, for in that in
which you judge another you condemn yourself; for you who judge do
the same things. <sup class="v">2:2</sup>But we know that the
judgment of God is according to truth against those who do such
things. <sup class="v">2:3</sup>But do you think this, O man, who
judge those doing such things and do the same, that you shall
escape the judgment of God? <sup class="v">2:4</sup>or do you
despise the riches of his goodness and forbearance and long
suffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to a
change of mind? <sup class="v">2:5</sup>But according to your
hardness and unchanged heart you treasure up wrath for yourself in
the day of wrath and of a revelation of the righteous judgment of
God, <sup class="v">2:6</sup>who will render to each according to
his works; <sup class="v">2:7</sup>to those who by patience in good
works seek for glory and honor and immortality, eternal life;
<sup class="v">2:8</sup>but to those who are contentions and
disobey the truth, and obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath.
<sup class="v">2:9</sup>Affliction and distress [shall be] on every
soul of man that does evil, both the Jew first and the Greek;
<sup class="v">2:10</sup>and glory and honor and peace to every one
that does good, both the Jew first and the Greek.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">2:11</sup>For there is no respect
of persons with God. <sup class="v">2:12</sup>For as many as have
sinned without the law shall perish without the law, and as many as
have sinned with the law shall be judged by the law,&mdash;
<sup class="v">2:13</sup>for not the hearers of the law are
righteous with God, but the doers of the law shall be justified;
<sup class="v">2:14</sup>for when the nations which have not the
law perform by nature [the commandments] of the law, these who have
not the law are a law to themselves, <sup class="v">2:15</sup>and
they show the work of the law written in their minds, their
consciences testifying with them, and their judgments mutually
accusing or defending one another;&mdash; <sup class=
"v">2:16</sup>in the day when God shall judge the secret [doings]
of men according to my gospel through Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">2:17</sup>But [what] if you are
called a Jew and rest on the law, and boast of God, <sup class=
"v">2:18</sup>and know his will, and approve of things which are
excellent, being instructed by the law, <sup class=
"v">2:19</sup>and believe yourself to be a guide of the blind, a
light of those in darkness, <sup class="v">2:20</sup>an instructor
of the foolish, a teacher of babes, having the form of knowledge
and of the truth in the law; <sup class="v">2:21</sup>you that
teach another, do you not teach yourself? You that preach not to
steal, do you steal? <sup class="v">2:22</sup>You that command not
to commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You that abhor idols,
do you commit sacrilege? <sup class="v">2:23</sup>You who boast of
the law, by the transgression of the law do you dishonor God?
<sup class="v">2:24</sup>For the name of God is blasphemed on your
account among the nations as it is written.</p>
<p class="pin">8 <sup class="v">2:25</sup>For circumcision indeed
is profitable if you perform the law, but if you are a transgressor
of the law, your circumcision becomes uncircumcision. <sup class=
"v">2:26</sup>If therefore the uncircumcision keeps the ordinances
of the law, shall not its uncircumcision be accounted for
circumcision? <sup class="v">2:27</sup>And the uncircumcision by
nature which keeps the law shall judge you who with the written law
and circumcision are a transgressor of the law. <sup class=
"v">2:28</sup>For not that which is external is the Jew, nor is
that which is external in the flesh circumcision. <sup class=
"v">2:29</sup>But that which is in secret is the Jew, and
circumcision of the heart is in the spirit not in the writing, the
commendation of which is not of men but of God.</p>
<p class="pin">9 <sup class="v">3:1</sup>What then is the
preeminence of the Jew? or what the profit of circumcision?
<sup class="v">3:2</sup>Much in every way. For first, indeed, that
they were entrusted with the oracles of God. <sup class=
"v">3:3</sup>For what if some did not believe? Will their unbelief
destroy the faith of God? <sup class="v">3:4</sup>By no means; but
let God be true, and every man a liar; as it is written, That thou
mayest be justified in thy sayings and overcome when thou art
judged.</p>
<p class="pin">10 <sup class="v">3:5</sup>But if our
unrighteousness commends the righteousness of God, what shall we
say? Is God unrighteous who inflicts wrath? I speak as a
man;&mdash; <sup class="v">3:6</sup>by no means;&mdash;since [if he
was] how shall God judge the world? <sup class="v">3:7</sup>For if
the truth of God abounded by my falsehood to his glory, why am I
also yet judged as a sinner? <sup class="v">3:8</sup>And as we are
falsely accused and as some declare that we say, [do we say] Let us
do evil that good may come? Whose judgment is just.</p>
<p class="pin">11 <sup class="v">3:9</sup>What defense then have
we? None at all; for we before asserted that both Jews and Greeks
are all under sin, <sup class="v">3:10</sup>as it is written, There
is none righteous not one, <sup class="v">3:11</sup>there is none
that understands, there is none that seeks God; <sup class=
"v">3:12</sup>all have turned aside, they have together become
unprofitable; there is no one that does good, there is not even
one; <sup class="v">3:13</sup>their throat is an opened tomb, with
their tongues they practise deceit, the poison of asps is under
their lips. <sup class="v">3:14</sup>Their mouth is full of cursing
and bitterness. <sup class="v">3:15</sup>Their feet are swift to
shed blood, <sup class="v">3:16</sup>destruction and misery are in
their ways, <sup class="v">3:17</sup>and the way of peace they have
not known. <sup class="v">3:18</sup>There is no fear of God before
their eyes. <sup class="v">3:19</sup>But we know that whatever the
law says, it says to those having the law, that every mouth may be
stopped and all the world become guilty before God. <sup class=
"v">3:20</sup>Wherefore by the works of the law there shall no
flesh be justified is his sight, for by the law there is an
acknowledgment of sin.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<h3>GOD'S RIGHTEOUSNESS BY FAITH SAVES BOTH JEWS AND GENTILES.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">3:21</sup>BUT now God's
righteousness has been made manifest without the law, being
testified to by the law and the prophets, <sup class=
"v">3:22</sup>but God's righteousness is through the faith of Jesus
Christ, in all and upon all that believe. For there is no
difference; <sup class="v">3:23</sup>for all have sinned and come
short of the glory of God, <sup class="v">3:24</sup>being justified
freely by his grace through the redemption in Christ Jesus,
<sup class="v">3:25</sup>whom God set forth [to be] a propitiator
through faith in his blood, to show his righteousness because of
the passing by of the errors committed previously in the
forbearance of God, <sup class="v">3:26</sup>to show his
righteousness at the present time, that he may be righteous and
justify him that is of faith.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">3:27</sup>Where then is the
boasting [of the Jew]? It is excluded. By what law? Of works? No;
but by the law of faith. <sup class="v">3:28</sup>We conclude then
that a man is justified by faith without the works of the law.
<sup class="v">3:29</sup>Is God [a God] of the Jews alone? and not
also of the gentiles? Yes, also of the gentiles, <sup class=
"v">3:30</sup>since there is one God who will justify the
circumcision by faith and the uncircumcision through the [same]
faith. <sup class="v">3:31</sup>Do we then abrogate the law by the
faith? By no means; but we establish the law.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">4:1</sup>What shall we say then
that Abraham our father found according to the flesh? <sup class=
"v">4:2</sup>For if Abraham was justified by works he has [occasion
for] boasting, but not before God. <sup class="v">4:3</sup>For what
says the Scripture? And Abraham believed God and it was accounted
to him for righteousness. <sup class="v">4:4</sup>But to one that
works the reward is not accounted by grace but by debt. <sup class=
"v">4:5</sup>But to one that works not, but believes on him that
justifies the wicked, his faith is [accounted] for righteousness.
<sup class="v">4:6</sup>As David describes the blessedness of the
man to whom the Lord accounts righteousness without works,
<sup class="v">4:7</sup>Blessed are they whose transgressions are
forgiven and whose sins are covered; <sup class=
"v">4:8</sup>blessed is the man to whom the Lord does not account
sin.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">4:9</sup>Is this blessedness then
on the circumcision? or also on the uncircumcision? [Also on the
uncircumcision.] For we say that faith was accounted to Abraham for
righteousness. <sup class="v">4:10</sup>How then was it accounted?
when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in
circumcision, but in uncircumcision. <sup class="v">4:11</sup>And
he received the symbol of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness
of the faith which was in uncircumcision, so that he became the
father of all that believe in uncircumcision, that righteousness
may also be accounted to them, <sup class="v">4:12</sup>and a
father of circumcision not to those of the circumcision only, but
to those also who walk in the steps of the faith of our father
Abraham which was in uncircumcision.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">4:13</sup>For the promise to
Abraham and his posterity that he should inherit the world was not
through the law but through the righteousness of faith. <sup class=
"v">4:14</sup>For if the subjects of the law are heirs, the faith
is done away and the promise abrogated. <sup class=
"v">4:15</sup>For the law produces wrath; for where there is no law
there is no transgression. <sup class="v">4:16</sup>Therefore it is
by faith that it may be by grace, that the promise may be sure to
all the posterity, not to that of the law only but to that of the
faith of Abraham, who is a father of us all, <sup class=
"v">4:17</sup>as it is written, I have made you a father of many
nations before God in whom he believed, who makes the dead alive
and calls things which do not exist as existing.&mdash; <sup class=
"v">4:18</sup>who against hope believed in hope that he should
become a father of many nations according to the saying shall your
posterity be. <sup class="v">4:19</sup>And being not weak in faith,
he did not regard himself as dead, being now about a hundred years
old, nor Sarah's incapacity for child-bearing, <sup class=
"v">4:20</sup>and he did not doubt the promise of God by unbelief,
but was strong in faith, giving glory to God, <sup class=
"v">4:21</sup>being fully persuaded that what he had promised he
was able to perform. <sup class="v">4:22</sup>Wherefore also it was
accounted to him for righteousness. <sup class="v">4:23</sup>But it
was not written for his sake alone, that it was accounted to him,
<sup class="v">4:24</sup>but also for our sakes, to whom it is
about to be accounted if we believe on him that raised Jesus our
Lord from the dead, <sup class="v">4:25</sup>who was delivered up
for our sins and raised for our justification.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">5:1</sup>Having been justified
therefore by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus
Christ, <sup class="v">5:2</sup>through whom also we have been
introduced into this grace in which we stand, and rejoice in the
hope of the glory of God. <sup class="v">5:3</sup>And not only
[this], but we rejoice also in afflictions, knowing that affliction
works out patience, <sup class="v">5:4</sup>and patience,
experience, and experience, hope; <sup class="v">5:5</sup>and the
hope makes not ashamed, because the love of God has been poured out
in our hearts through the Holy Spirit given us. <sup class=
"v">5:6</sup>For when we were yet weak, in due time Christ died for
the wicked; <sup class="v">5:7</sup>for scarcely for a righteous
man will one die, but for a good man some one perhaps would even
dare to die; <sup class="v">5:8</sup>but God commends his love to
us, that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us; <sup class=
"v">5:9</sup>much more then being now justified by his blood, we
shall be saved through him from wrath. <sup class="v">5:10</sup>For
if when enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of his
Son, much more having become reconciled we shall be saved in his
life. <sup class="v">5:11</sup>And not only so, but we also rejoice
in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we received the
present reconciliation.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">5:12</sup>Therefore, as through
one man sin entered into the world and death through sin, and so
came upon all men because all sinned,&mdash; <sup class=
"v">5:13</sup>for till the law there was sin in the world, but sin
is not accounted where there is no law <sup class="v">5:14</sup>but
death reigned from Adam till Moses even over those that sinned not
after the similitude Adam's transgression, who is a type of him
that was to come; <sup class="v">5:15</sup>but not as the fall so
also is the gift; for if by the fall of one the many died, much
more the grace of God and the gift by grace which is of the one man
Jesus Christ, abounded to the many; <sup class="v">5:16</sup>and
not as through one that sinned is the gift; for the judgment was by
one to condemnation, but the gift was from many sins to a righteous
ordinance; <sup class="v">5:17</sup>for if by one fall death
reigned through the one, much more those who receive the abundance
of the grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life
through the one, Jesus Christ;&mdash; <sup class=
"v">5:18</sup>therefore, as through the fall of one [judgment came]
on all men to condemnation, so also through the righteous ordinance
of one [the gift comes] on all men to justification of life;
<sup class="v">5:19</sup>for as through the disobedience of the one
man the many were constituted sinners, so also through the
obedience of the one shall the many be constituted righteous.
<sup class="v">5:20</sup>For the law supervened that the fall might
abound; but where the sin abounded the grace was superabundant,
<sup class="v">5:21</sup>that as sin reigned in death, so the grace
shall reign through righteousness in life eternal through Jesus
Christ our Lord.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<h3>SIN IS ON NO ACCOUNT TO BE ALLOWED.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">6:1</sup>WHAT shall we say then?
Shall we continue in sin, that the grace may abound? <sup class=
"v">6:2</sup>By no means. How shall we who died to sin any longer
live in it? <sup class="v">6:3</sup>Do you not know that as many of
us as were baptized in Christ were baptized in his death?
<sup class="v">6:4</sup>We have been buried therefore with him
through baptism in death, that as Christ was raised from the dead
through the glory of the Father, so we also should walk in newness
of life. <sup class="v">6:5</sup>For if we have been planted
together in the likeness of his death, we shall much more be of his
resurrection; <sup class="v">6:6</sup>knowing this that our old man
was crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed,
that we should no longer serve sin; <sup class="v">6:7</sup>for he
that died was justified from sin. <sup class="v">6:8</sup>And if we
died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him;
<sup class="v">6:9</sup>knowing that Christ being raised from the
dead dies no more; death has no longer a lordship over him.
<sup class="v">6:10</sup>For [the death] which he died, he died to
sin once; but [the life] which he lives, he lives to God.
<sup class="v">6:11</sup>So also account yourselves dead indeed to
sin, but living to God in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">6:12</sup>Let not sin therefore
reign in your mortal bodies, to obey its desires, <sup class=
"v">6:13</sup>neither present your members as instruments of
wickedness to sin, but present yourselves to God as living from the
dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God.
<sup class="v">6:14</sup>For sin shall not have a Lordship over
you; for you are not under the law but under the grace.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">6:15</sup>What then? Shall we sin
because we are not under the law but under the grace? By no means.
<sup class="v">6:16</sup>Know you not that to whom you present
yourselves servants for obedience, his servants you are whom you
obey, whether of sin in death or of obedience in righteousness?
<sup class="v">6:17</sup>But thanks be to God that you were
servants of sin, but obeyed from the heart the form of teaching in
which you were instructed, <sup class="v">6:18</sup>and having
become free from sin you served righteousness. <sup class=
"v">6:19</sup>I speak after the manner of men on account of the
weakness of your flesh. For as you presented your members servants
to impurity and to wickedness in wickedness, so now present your
members servants to righteousness in sanctification. <sup class=
"v">6:20</sup>For when you were servants of sin, you were free from
righteousness. <sup class="v">6:21</sup>What fruit had you
therefore then in things of which you are now ashamed? for the end
of them is death. <sup class="v">6:22</sup>But now having been made
free from sin and made servants to God, you have your fruit in
sanctification, and the end eternal life. <sup class=
"v">6:23</sup>For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is
eternal life by Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>
<h3>THOSE IN CHRIST DEAD TO THE LAW, THE FLESH THE PRINCIPLE OF
SIN, ITS DOMINION OVER THE MIND, ETC.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">7:1</sup>ARE you ignorant,
brothers, for I speak to them who understand law, that the law has
authority over a man as long as he lives? <sup class=
"v">7:2</sup>For a woman under a husband is bound by law to a
living husband; but if the husband has died she is released from
the law of the husband. <sup class="v">7:3</sup>Therefore while the
husband lives, she shall be called an adulteress if she is married
to another man; but if the husband has died, she is free from the
law, so that she is not an adulteress if married to another man.
<sup class="v">7:4</sup>So, my brothers, you have also died to the
law through the body of Christ, that you should be married to
another, to him that was raised from the dead, that we should bear
fruit to God. <sup class="v">7:5</sup>For when we were in the
flesh, the sinful affections operated through the law in our
members to bear fruit to death; <sup class="v">7:6</sup>but now we
are released from the law by which we were held having died, that
we should serve [God] in newness of spirit, not in the old age of a
writing.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">7:7</sup>What shall we say then?
Is the law sin? By no means. On the contrary I knew not sin except
through the law; for I had not known inordinate desire, unless the
law had said, You shall not desire inordinately. <sup class=
"v">7:8</sup>But Sin having taken occasion through the commandment
wrought in me every inordinate desire; for without the law sin was
dead.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">7:9</sup>And I was alive without
the law once, but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I
died, <sup class="v">7:10</sup>and the commandment which was for
life was found to be for death. <sup class="v">7:11</sup>For sin
having taken occasion through the commandment deceived me, and
through it killed me. <sup class="v">7:12</sup>The law therefore is
holy, and the commandment holy and righteous and good. <sup class=
"v">7:13</sup>Did then that which is good become death to me? By no
means, but sin; that sin might be made manifest, producing death to
me through that which is good, that sin might become exceedingly
sinful through the commandment. <sup class="v">7:14</sup>For we
know that the law is spiritual; but I am carnal, sold under sin.
<sup class="v">7:15</sup>For what I do this I approve not; for I do
not what I wish, but what I hate, this I do. <sup class=
"v">7:16</sup>But if what I wish not this I do, I consent to the
law that it is good; <sup class="v">7:17</sup>and now I no longer
do it, but the sin that dwells in me. <sup class="v">7:18</sup>For
I know that in me, that is in my flesh, there dwells no good. For
to wish is present with me, but to do the good is not; <sup class=
"v">7:19</sup>for the good which I wish I do not, but the evil
which I wish not this I do.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">7:20</sup>But if what I wish not
this I do, I no longer do it, but sin which dwells in me.
<sup class="v">7:21</sup>I find therefore the law, that when I wish
to do good evil is present with me; <sup class="v">7:22</sup>for I
consent to the law of God as to my inward man, [my soul],
<sup class="v">7:23</sup>but I see another law in my members
warring against the law of my mind, and making me captive to the
law of sin which is in my members. <sup class=
"v">7:24</sup>Miserable man that I am; who will deliver me from the
body of this death? <sup class="v">7:25</sup>Thanks be to God
through Jesus Christ our Lord; therefore I myself with the mind
serve the law of God, and with the flesh the law of sin.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<h3>THOSE IN CHRIST NOT SUBJECT TO CONDEMNATION, NOR TO THE FLESH,
BUT RULED BY THE HOLY SPIRIT, ETC.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">8:1</sup>THERE is no condemnation
therefore to those in Christ Jesus; <sup class="v">8:2</sup>for the
law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus made me free from the law
of sin and death. <sup class="v">8:3</sup>For what the law could
not do because it was weak through the flesh, God having sent his
Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned the sin
in the flesh, <sup class="v">8:4</sup>that the righteous ordinance
of the law may be performed by us who walk not according to the
flesh, but according to the spirit. <sup class="v">8:5</sup>For
they who are according to the flesh mind the things of the flesh,
but they who are according to the spirit the things of the spirit;
<sup class="v">8:6</sup>for the minding of the flesh is death, but
the minding of the Spirit is life and peace. <sup class=
"v">8:7</sup>Because the minding of the flesh is enmity against
God; for it is not subject to the law of God; for it can not be.
<sup class="v">8:8</sup>And they that are in the flesh cannot
please God. <sup class="v">8:9</sup>But you are not in the flesh
but in the spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. And
if any man has not the spirit of Christ he is not his. <sup class=
"v">8:10</sup>But if Christ is in you, the body is dead on account
of sin, but the spirit is life on account of righteousness.
<sup class="v">8:11</sup>And if the Spirit of him that raised Jesus
from the dead dwells in you, he that raised Christ from the dead
shall make alive your mortal bodies through his Spirit that dwells
in you.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">8:12</sup>Therefore, brothers, we
are debtors not to the flesh to live according to the flesh.
<sup class="v">8:13</sup>For if you live according to the flesh,
you shall die; but if by the spirit you kill the deeds of the body,
you shall live. <sup class="v">8:14</sup>For as many as are led by
the Spirit of God they are sons of God. <sup class=
"v">8:15</sup>For you received not the spirit of servitude again to
fear, but you received the spirit of adoption, by which we cry;
Abba, Father. <sup class="v">8:16</sup>The Spirit itself is a
co-witness with our spirits that we are children of God.
<sup class="v">8:17</sup>And if children, [we are] also heirs,
heirs indeed of God and co-heirs with Christ, if we suffer with him
that we may also be glorified with him.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">8:18</sup>For I think that the
sufferings of the present time are of no account in comparison with
the glory to be revealed in us. <sup class="v">8:19</sup>For the
earnest expectation of the creation waits for the revelation of the
sons of God. <sup class="v">8:20</sup>For the creation was
subjected to a perishable condition, not willingly, but by him that
subjected it, in hope <sup class="v">8:21</sup>that the same
creation will be delivered from the servitude of destruction and
[brought] into the glorious liberty of the sons of God. <sup class=
"v">8:22</sup>For we know that all the creation groans and is in
pain till now; <sup class="v">8:23</sup>and not only it, but we
ourselves also who have the first fruit of the Spirit, even
ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, the
redemption of our bodies. <sup class="v">8:24</sup>For we are saved
by hope; but a hope that is seen is not a hope; for why does one
hope for what he sees? <sup class="v">8:25</sup>but if we hope for
what we see not, we wait for it with patience.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">8:26</sup>And in like manner also
the Spirit helps our weakness. For we know not what to pray for as
we ought, but the Spirit makes intercession for us with groanings
unutterable; <sup class="v">8:27</sup>and he that searches the
hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because it makes
intercession with God for the saints. <sup class="v">8:28</sup>And
we know that all things work together for good to those who love
God, to those who are called according to [his] purpose.
<sup class="v">8:29</sup>For whom he foreknew, he also
predestinated to be conformed to the likeness of his Son, that he
may be a first-born among many brothers; <sup class=
"v">8:30</sup>and whom he predestinated them he also called; and
whom he called them he also justified; and whom he justified them
he also glorified.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">8:31</sup>What shall we say then
to these things? If God is for us, who is against us? <sup class=
"v">8:32</sup>He who spared not his Son, but gave him up for us
all, how shall he not also with him freely give us all things?
<sup class="v">8:33</sup>Who will bring a charge against God's
elect? It is God that justifies; <sup class="v">8:34</sup>who is he
that condemns? Is it Christ who died, and still more, who has also
been raised, and who is on the right hand of God, and who makes
intercession for us? <sup class="v">8:35</sup>Who shall separate us
from the love of Christ? Shall affliction or distress, persecution
or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or the sword? <sup class=
"v">8:36</sup>As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the
day; we are accounted as sheep for slaughter. <sup class=
"v">8:37</sup>But in all these things we more than conquer, through
him who loved us. <sup class="v">8:38</sup>For I am persuaded that
neither death nor life, nor angels nor principalities, nor things
present nor things to come, nor powers, <sup class=
"v">8:39</sup>nor height, nor depth, nor any other creation, shall
be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our
Lord.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<h3>THE REJECTION OF THE UNBELIEVING JEWS.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">9:1</sup>I SPEAK the truth in
Christ, I lie not, my conscience bearing me witness with the Holy
Spirit, <sup class="v">9:2</sup>that I have great grief and
continual pain in my heart; <sup class="v">9:3</sup>for I have
wished that I was myself accursed from Christ for my brothers, my
kindred according to the flesh, <sup class="v">9:4</sup>who are
Israelites, whose are the adoption and the glory, and the covenants
and the giving of the law, and the service, and the promises,
<sup class="v">9:5</sup>whose are the fathers, and of whom is
Christ, according to the flesh. He who is over all is God blessed
forever, amen. <sup class="v">9:6</sup>Not that the word of God has
failed of being accomplished. For all are not Israel who are of
Israel; <sup class="v">9:7</sup>neither, because they are a
posterity of Abraham, are they all children; but in Isaac shall
your posterity be called; <sup class="v">9:8</sup>that is, the
children of the flesh are not the children of God, but the children
of the promise are accounted the posterity. <sup class=
"v">9:9</sup>For this was the word of promise; According to this
time I will come, and Sarah shall have a son. <sup class=
"v">9:10</sup>And not only this, but Rebecca also being with child
by one, by our father Isaac&mdash; <sup class="v">9:11</sup>for the
children not yet being born, nor having done any thing good or
evil, that the purpose of God according to election might continue,
not of works but of him that calls,&mdash; <sup class=
"v">9:12</sup>it was said to her that the older shall serve the
younger; <sup class="v">9:13</sup>as it is written; Jacob I loved,
but Esau I hated.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">9:14</sup>What shall we say then?
Is there unrighteousness with God? By no means. <sup class=
"v">9:15</sup>For he says to Moses, I will be merciful to him to
whom I may be merciful, and I will compassionate him whom I may
compassionate. <sup class="v">9:16</sup>Therefore, it is not of him
that wills nor of him that runs, but of God that exercises mercy.
<sup class="v">9:17</sup>For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, For
this same cause I raised you up, to show my power in you, and that
my name may be declared in all the earth. <sup class=
"v">9:18</sup>He therefore has mercy on whom he will, and whom he
will he hardens. <sup class="v">9:19</sup>You will say to me then,
Why then does he yet find fault? for who has resisted his will?
<sup class="v">9:20</sup>Yes indeed, O man, who are you that reply
against God? Shall the work say to him that made it, Why did you
make me thus? <sup class="v">9:21</sup>or has not the potter a
right, in respect to the clay, to make of the same mass one vessel
to honor and another to dishonor? <sup class="v">9:22</sup>But if
God wishing to show his wrath and to make known his power endured
with much long suffering vessels of wrath fitted for destruction,
<sup class="v">9:23</sup>and that he might make known the riches of
his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he before prepared for
glory, <sup class="v">9:24</sup>whom he also called, us not of the
Jews only but also of the gentiles, <sup class="v">9:25</sup>as he
says also in Hosea, I will call them that were not my people, my
people, and her that was not beloved, beloved, <sup class=
"v">9:26</sup>and in the place where it was said to them, You are
not my people, there they shall be called children of the living
God. <sup class="v">9:27</sup>But Isaiah cries concerning Israel,
Though the number of the children of Israel is as the sand of the
sea, a remnant shall be saved; <sup class="v">9:28</sup>for he
executes and performs his word in righteousness, for a finished
work will the Lord perform on the earth. <sup class=
"v">9:29</sup>As also Isaiah said before, Unless the Lord of
Sabaoth had left us a posterity, we should have been like Sodom,
and should have resembled Gomorrah.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">9:30</sup>What shall we say then?
That nations who did not pursue righteousness attained a
righteousness, but the righteousness which is by faith; <sup class=
"v">9:31</sup>but Israel who pursued the law of righteousness did
not attain to the law of righteousness. <sup class=
"v">9:32</sup>For what reason? Because they are not of faith, but
as it were of works of the law; for they stumbled at the stone of
stumbling, <sup class="v">9:33</sup>as it is written; Behold, I lay
in Zion a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense, and he that
believes on him shall not be ashamed.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">10:1</sup>Brothers, the earnest
desire and prayer of my heart for Israel is for their salvation.
<sup class="v">10:2</sup>For I bear them witness that they have a
zeal for God but not according to knowledge; <sup class=
"v">10:3</sup>for not knowing God's righteousness, and seeking to
set up their righteousness, they have not submitted themselves to
God's righteousness. <sup class="v">10:4</sup>For Christ is the end
of the law for righteousness to every one that believes.
<sup class="v">10:5</sup>For Moses describes the righteousness of
the law, that the man that does these things shall live by them.
<sup class="v">10:6</sup>But the righteousness by faith speaks
thus; Say not in your mind, who shall ascend into
heaven?&mdash;that is, to bring Christ down,&mdash; <sup class=
"v">10:7</sup>or who shall descend into the abyss?&mdash;that is,
to bring Christ up from the dead. <sup class="v">10:8</sup>But what
does it say? The word is nigh you, in your mouth and in your mind;
that is, the word of the faith which we preach. <sup class=
"v">10:9</sup>For if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus,
and believe with your mind that God raised him from the dead, you
shall be saved; <sup class="v">10:10</sup>for with the mind we
believe to righteousness, and with the mouth we confess to
salvation. <sup class="v">10:11</sup>For the Scripture says, No one
that believes in him shall be ashamed. <sup class=
"v">10:12</sup>For there is no difference between Jew and Greek;
for the same Lord of all is rich to all that call upon him.
<sup class="v">10:13</sup>For every one that calls on the name of
the Lord shall be saved. <sup class="v">10:14</sup>How then shall
they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they
believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear
without one preaching? <sup class="v">10:15</sup>and how shall they
preach unless they have been sent? as it is written, How beautiful
are the feet of those that publish good news of peace, that publish
good news of good things.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">10:16</sup>But all did not obey
the gospel; for Isaiah says, Lord, who believed our report?
<sup class="v">10:17</sup>Faith therefore comes by the report, and
the report by the word of God. <sup class="v">10:18</sup>But I say,
Did they not hear? Yes indeed; their voice went into all the earth,
and their words to the ends of the world. <sup class=
"v">10:19</sup>But I say, did not Israel know? First, Moses says, I
will provoke you by that which is not a nation, and by a foolish
nation will I excite you to anger. <sup class="v">10:20</sup>But
Isaiah is more bold and says, I was found by them that sought me
not, I was made manifest to them that inquired not after me.
<sup class="v">10:21</sup>But in respect to Israel he says, All the
day I stretched out my hands to a disobedient and contradicting
people.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<h3>THE SALVATION OF BELIEVING JEWS AND THE CALLING OF THE
GENTILES.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">11:1</sup>I SAY then, has God
cast away his people? By no means; for I also am an Israelite, of
the race of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin. <sup class=
"v">11:2</sup>God has not cast away his people whom he foreknew.
Know you not what the Scripture says in Elijah, how he intercedes
with God against Israel? <sup class="v">11:3</sup>Lord, they have
killed thy prophets, they have dug down thy altars, and I am left
alone, and they seek my life. <sup class="v">11:4</sup>But what
says the response to him? I have reserved for myself seven thousand
men, who have not bowed the knee to Baal. <sup class=
"v">11:5</sup>So then also at the present time there is a remnant
according to the election of grace; <sup class="v">11:6</sup>but if
by grace, no longer by works; for otherwise grace is no longer
grace; but if by works, it is no longer grace; for otherwise a work
is no longer a work. <sup class="v">11:7</sup>What then? What
Israel seeks, this it did not obtain, but the election obtained;
and the rest were hardened,&mdash; <sup class="v">11:8</sup>as it
is written, God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that they should
not see, and ears that they should not hear&mdash;to this day.
<sup class="v">11:9</sup>And David says, Let their table become a
trap and a snare and an offense and a stumbling block to them;
<sup class="v">11:10</sup>let their eyes be darkened that they may
not see, and bow down their back always.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">11:11</sup>I say then, have they
stumbled that they should fall? By no means; but by their fall the
nations have salvation to excite them to emulation. <sup class=
"v">11:12</sup>But if their fall is the riches of the world, and
their diminution the riches of nations, how much more will their
fullness be. <sup class="v">11:13</sup>For I speak to you,
gentiles. Inasmuch as I am an apostle of the gentiles, I glorify my
ministry, <sup class="v">11:14</sup>if perhaps I may excite my
flesh [race] to emulation and save some of them. <sup class=
"v">11:15</sup>For if their falling away is the reconciling of the
world, what will their recovery be but life from the dead?
<sup class="v">11:16</sup>And if the first fruit is holy, the mass
is also; and if the root is holy, the branches also are.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">11:17</sup>But if some of the
branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive, were grafted
in among them and became a partaker of the root and excellence of
the olive, <sup class="v">11:18</sup>boast not against the
branches; but if you boast, you bear not the root, but the root
you. <sup class="v">11:19</sup>You will say then, The branches were
broken off that I might be grafted in. <sup class=
"v">11:20</sup>Well; they were broken off by unbelief, and you
stand by faith. Be not high-minded, but fear; <sup class=
"v">11:21</sup>for if God spared not the natural branches, perhaps
he will not spare you. <sup class="v">11:22</sup>See then the
goodness and severity of God; towards those that fell, severity,
but towards you, the goodness of God, if you continue in goodness,
for otherwise you also will be cut off. <sup class=
"v">11:23</sup>And they, if they continue not in unbelief, will be
grafted in; for God is able to graft them in again. <sup class=
"v">11:24</sup>For if you have been cut from an olive wild by
nature, and grafted contrary to nature into a good olive, how much
more shall they according to nature be grafted into their own
olive.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">11:25</sup>For I wish you not to
be ignorant, brothers, of this mystery; that you may not be wise in
your own conceit. For hardness in part has come upon Israel, till
the fullness of the gentiles shall come in, <sup class=
"v">11:26</sup>and so all Israel shall be saved; as it is written,
A deliverer shall come from Zion, he shall turn away impiety from
Jacob. <sup class="v">11:27</sup>And this is the promise to them
from me, when I take away their sins. <sup class="v">11:28</sup>As
to the gospel, they are enemies on your account, but as to the
election, they are beloved on account of the fathers; <sup class=
"v">11:29</sup>for the gifts and calling of God are without a
change of mind. <sup class="v">11:30</sup>For as you once disobeyed
God, but now have obtained mercy by their disobedience, <sup class=
"v">11:31</sup>so also they now have disobeyed that they may obtain
mercy by your mercy. <sup class="v">11:32</sup>For God has
concluded all in disobedience that he may have mercy on all.
<sup class="v">11:33</sup>O the depth of the riches both of the
wisdom and knowledge of God! how inscrutable are his judgments, and
his ways can not be explored! <sup class="v">11:34</sup>For who
knew the mind of the Lord? or who was his counsellor? <sup class=
"v">11:35</sup>or who first gave to him, and it shall be repaid
him? <sup class="v">11:36</sup>For of him and through him, and in
him are all things; to him be glory forever; amen.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<h3>MORAL AND POLITICAL DUTIES.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">12:1</sup>I EXHORT you,
therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies
a living sacrifice; holy, well pleasing to God, your reasonable
service; <sup class="v">12:2</sup>and be not conformed to this
life, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind, that you may
prove what is the will of God which is good and well-pleasing and
perfect. <sup class="v">12:3</sup>For I say through the grace given
me, to every one among you, not to be higher-minded than he ought
to be, but to think soberly, as God has distributed to each the
measure of faith. <sup class="v">12:4</sup>For as we have many
members in one body, and all the members have not the same office,
<sup class="v">12:5</sup>so we, the many, are one body in Christ,
and each one members one of another; <sup class="v">12:6</sup>but
having different gifts according to the grace given us, if prophecy
[let us prophesy] according to the analogy of the faith,
<sup class="v">12:7</sup>if a service [let us labor] in the
service, if one teaches, in teaching, <sup class="v">12:8</sup>if
one exhorts in the exhortation, he that gives, with simplicity, he
that rules, with diligence, he that exercises mercy, with
cheerfulness.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">12:9</sup>Let love be without
hypocrisy. Abhor evil, adhere to that which is good, <sup class=
"v">12:10</sup>be kindly disposed one to another with brotherly
love, in honor prefer one another, <sup class="v">12:11</sup>be not
slothful in business, be fervent in spirit, serve the Lord,
<sup class="v">12:12</sup>rejoice in the hope, be patient in
affliction, be persevering in prayer, <sup class=
"v">12:13</sup>contribute to the necessity of saints, practise
hospitality. <sup class="v">12:14</sup>Bless those that persecute,
bless and curse not. <sup class="v">12:15</sup>Rejoice with the
rejoicing, weep with the weeping. <sup class="v">12:16</sup>Desire
the same thing one for another; desire not the high, but be
satisfied with the humble. Be not wise in your own conceit.
<sup class="v">12:17</sup>Render evil for evil to no one, provide
things honorable in the sight of all men; <sup class=
"v">12:18</sup>if possible, as much as may be in your power, live
peaceably with all men, <sup class="v">12:19</sup>not vindicating
yourselves, beloved, but give place to wrath; for it is written,
Judgment is mine, I will repay, says the Lord. <sup class=
"v">12:20</sup>If therefore your enemy is hungry, give him food; if
he is thirsty, give him drink; for doing this you shall heap coals
of fire on his head. <sup class="v">12:21</sup>Be not overcome by
evil, but overcome evil with good.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">13:1</sup>Let every soul be
subject to the superior powers. For there is no power except from
God, and the [powers] which exist have been ordained by God.
<sup class="v">13:2</sup>So that he who resists the power resists
the ordinance of God; and those who resist shall receive judgment
on themselves. <sup class="v">13:3</sup>For rulers are not a terror
to good works, but to evil. Will you not fear the power? Do good,
and you shall have praise from it; <sup class="v">13:4</sup>for
[the power] is God's minister to you for good. But if you do evil,
fear; for it bears not the sword in vain; for it is God's minister
of justice for punishment to him that does evil. <sup class=
"v">13:5</sup>Wherefore it is necessary to be in subjection, not
only on account of punishment, but also on account of
conscience.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">13:6</sup>For on this account
also you pay taxes; for [magistrates] are servants of God attending
constantly to this same thing. <sup class="v">13:7</sup>Pay to all
their dues; a tax to whom a tax is due, a toll to whom a toll is
due, fear to whom fear, and honor to whom honor. <sup class=
"v">13:8</sup>Owe no man any thing, except to love one another; for
he that loves another has fully performed the law. <sup class=
"v">13:9</sup>For this, You shall not commit adultery, You shall
not kill, You shall not steal, You shall not desire inordinately,
and if there is any other commandment, it is summarily comprehended
in this word; You shall love your neighbor as yourself. <sup class=
"v">13:10</sup>Love does no evil to a neighbor; love therefore is
the sum of the law. <sup class="v">13:11</sup>And [do] this,
knowing the time, that it is already the hour that we should be
waked from sleep, for now is our salvation nearer than when we
believed. <sup class="v">13:12</sup>The night is far advanced, and
the day is at hand; let us lay aside therefore the works of
darkness, and let us put on the armor of light. <sup class=
"v">13:13</sup>Let us walk becomingly, as in the day; not in
revelries and drinking, not in lewdness and excesses, not in strife
and envy; <sup class="v">13:14</sup>but put on the Lord Jesus
Christ, and make no provision for desires of the flesh.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>
<h3>DUTIES TO THE WEAK, ETC.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">14:1</sup>RECEIVE the weak in
faith, not to doubtful reasonings. <sup class="v">14:2</sup>For one
has faith to eat all things, but he that is weak eats vegetables.
<sup class="v">14:3</sup>Let not him that eats despise him that
eats not; and let not him that eats not judge him that eats; for
God has accepted him. <sup class="v">14:4</sup>Who are you that
judge another man's servant? To his master he stands or falls; and
he shall be made to stand, for God is able to make him stand.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">14:5</sup>One judges one day to
be better than another, but another judges every day [to be alike].
Let each one be fully persuaded in his mind. <sup class=
"v">14:6</sup>He that observes the day observes it to the Lord, and
he that observes not the day observes it not to the Lord. And he
that eats eats to the Lord, for he gives God thanks; and he that
eats not eats not to the Lord, and gives God thanks. <sup class=
"v">14:7</sup>For no one of us lives for himself; and no one dies
for himself; <sup class="v">14:8</sup>for if we live, we live for
the Lord, and if we die, we die for the Lord; whether therefore we
live, or whether we die, we are the Lord's. <sup class=
"v">14:9</sup>For this end Christ died and lived again, that he
might exercise lordship over the dead and living. <sup class=
"v">14:10</sup>But why do you judge your brother? why do you set at
nought your brother? for we must all stand at the tribunal of God.
<sup class="v">14:11</sup>For it is written, [As] I live, says the
Lord, to me every knee shall bow, and every tongue confess to God.
<sup class="v">14:12</sup>Each of us therefore shall give account
of himself to God.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">14:13</sup>Let us not therefore
judge one another, but judge this rather, not to place a
stumbling-block or an offense before a brother. <sup class=
"v">14:14</sup>I know, and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that
nothing is defiled in itself, except to him that thinks any thing
to be defiled; to him it is defiled. <sup class="v">14:15</sup>For
if your brother is grieved by your food, you no longer walk in
love. Destroy not with your food him for whom Christ died.
<sup class="v">14:16</sup>Let not your good therefore be
injuriously spoken of. <sup class="v">14:17</sup>For the kingdom of
God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness, and peace, and
joy in the Holy Spirit; <sup class="v">14:18</sup>for he that in
this serves Christ is well pleasing to God and approved by men.
<sup class="v">14:19</sup>Let us therefore pursue the things of
peace and those which edify one another. <sup class=
"v">14:20</sup>On account of food destroy not the work of God. All
things indeed are pure, but evil is to the man that eats with
offense; <sup class="v">14:21</sup>it is good not to eat meat nor
drink wine, nor [do] any thing by which your brother stumbles.
<sup class="v">14:22</sup>You have faith; have it for yourself
before God, Blessed is he that condemns not himself in what he
approves; <sup class="v">14:23</sup>but he that doubts is condemned
if he eats, because it is not of faith; and every thing which is
not of faith is sin.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">15:1</sup>And we, the strong,
ought to bear the infirmities of those who are not strong, and not
to please ourselves. <sup class="v">15:2</sup>Let us each please
our neighbor in that which is good for edification; <sup class=
"v">15:3</sup>for Christ also pleased not himself, but, as it is
written, The reproaches of those that reproached thee fell on me.
<sup class="v">15:4</sup>For those things which were written before
were written for our instruction, that through patience and the
consolation of the Scriptures we may have hope. <sup class=
"v">15:5</sup>And the God of patience and consolation grant you to
have the same mind one to another, according to Christ Jesus,
<sup class="v">15:6</sup>that being of one mind you may glorify the
God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ with one mouth.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">15:7</sup>Wherefore receive one
another, as Christ also received you to the glory of God.
<sup class="v">15:8</sup>For I say that Christ was made a minister
of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises
of the fathers, <sup class="v">15:9</sup>and that the nations
should glorify God for mercy; as it is written, For this cause will
I praise thee among nations, and sing to thy name. <sup class=
"v">15:10</sup>And again he says, Rejoice nations with his people.
<sup class="v">15:11</sup>And again, Praise the Lord, all nations,
and let all peoples praise him. <sup class="v">15:12</sup>And
again, Isaiah says, There shall be a root of Jesse and he shall
stand up to rule nations, in him shall nations hope. <sup class=
"v">15:13</sup>And may the God of hope fill you with all joy and
peace in believing, that you may abound in hope by the power of the
Holy Spirit.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">15:14</sup>And I am persuaded, my
brothers, even I myself, concerning you, that you are full of
kindness, filled with all knowledge, and able to admonish one
another; <sup class="v">15:15</sup>but I have written more boldly
to you in part, to refresh your minds on account of the grace given
me by God <sup class="v">15:16</sup>that I should be a servant of
Christ Jesus to the nations, administering as a priest the gospel
of God, that the offering of the nations may be acceptable,
sanctified by the Holy Spirit. <sup class="v">15:17</sup>I have
therefore cause of boasting in Christ Jesus in respect to things
relating to God; <sup class="v">15:18</sup>for I dare not to speak
of what Christ has not performed by me for the obedience of the
nations, by word and work, <sup class="v">15:19</sup>by the power
of miracles and prodigies, by the power of the Spirit, so that from
Jerusalem and around as far as Illyricum I have fully preached the
gospel of Christ. <sup class="v">15:20</sup>And I have been anxious
so to preach where Christ was not named, that I might not build on
another's foundation; <sup class="v">15:21</sup>but as it is
written, They shall see to whom nothing was told concerning him,
and they who have not heard shall understand.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">15:22</sup>Wherefore I was also
much hindered from coming to you; <sup class="v">15:23</sup>but now
having no longer a place in these regions, and having a desire to
come to you for many years, <sup class="v">15:24</sup>should I go
to Spain I will come to you; for I hope, going by, to see you, and
to be sent forward by you there, when first I am in part filled
with you. <sup class="v">15:25</sup>But now I am going to Jerusalem
to serve the saints. <sup class="v">15:26</sup>For Macedonia and
Achaia have been pleased to make some contribution for the poor of
the saints at Jerusalem. <sup class="v">15:27</sup>They have been
pleased indeed, and their debtors they are; for if the nations have
participated in their spiritual things, they ought also to serve
them in things pertaining to the flesh. <sup class=
"v">15:28</sup>Having therefore performed this, and sealed to them
this service, I will go by you to Spain; <sup class=
"v">15:29</sup>and I know that when I come to you I shall come in
the fullness of the blessing of Christ. <sup class=
"v">15:30</sup>But I exhort you by the Lord Jesus Christ, and by
the love of the Spirit, to strive together with me in prayers to
God for me, <sup class="v">15:31</sup>that I may be delivered from
those that obey not in Judea, and that my service which is for
Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints, <sup class=
"v">15:32</sup>that I may come to you with joy by the will of God,
and be refreshed together with you. <sup class="v">15:33</sup>And
may the God of peace be with you all; amen.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
<h3>COMMENDATION OF PHOEBE, SALUTATIONS, ETC.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">16:1</sup>AND I commend to you
Phoebe our sister, who is a minister of the church in Cenchrea,
<sup class="v">16:2</sup>that you receive her in the Lord worthily
of the saints, and assist her in any thing in which she may have
need of you; for she has been an assistant of many, and of myself
also.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">16:3</sup>Salute Prisca
[Priscilla] and Aquila my co-laborers in Christ Jesus, <sup class=

his mother and mine. <sup class="v">16:14</sup>Salute Asyncritus,
Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and the brothers with them.
<sup class="v">16:15</sup>Salute Philologus and Julia, Nereus and
his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints with them. <sup class=
"v">16:16</sup>Salute one another with a holy kiss. All the
churches of Christ salute you.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">16:17</sup>I exhort you,
brothers, to observe those that cause dissensions and offenses
contrary to the teaching which you learned, and avoid them;
<sup class="v">16:18</sup>for such serve not our anointed Lord, but
themselves, And by kind and complimentary words deceive the minds
of the simple. <sup class="v">16:19</sup>For your obedience has
come to all; I rejoice in you therefore, but I wish you to be wise
for that which is good, and simple for evil. <sup class=
"v">16:20</sup>And the God of peace shall crush Satan under your
feet shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.</p>

<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">1:1</sup>PAUL, a prisoner of

our fellow-laborer, <sup class="v">1:2</sup>and to the beloved

God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">1:4</sup>I thank my God, always
making mention of you in my prayers, <sup class=

Lord Jesus and for all the saints, <sup class="v">1:6</sup>that
your participation of the faith may be made effectual by a
knowledge of all the good which we have in Christ Jesus.
<sup class="v">1:7</sup>For I have great joy and comfort in your
love, because the saints are refreshed by you, brother. <sup class=

is fit, <sup class="v">1:9</sup>on account of love I rather
request; being such as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of

Onesimus, whom I obtained in my bonds, <sup class="v">1:11</sup>who
was formerly not useful to you but is now most useful to you and
me, <sup class="v">1:12</sup>whom I have sent back. And do you
receive him, that is, my soul, <sup class="v">1:13</sup>whom I
should like to retain for myself, that he might serve me for you in
the bonds of the gospel, <sup class="v">1:14</sup>but without your
consent I will do nothing, that your service may not be compulsory
but voluntary; <sup class="v">1:15</sup>for perhaps he has been
separated from you for a time that you may have him back forever,
<sup class="v">1:16</sup>no longer as a servant, but above a
servant, a brother beloved, especially to me, but how much more to
you, both in the flesh and in the Lord. <sup class="v">1:17</sup>If
therefore you regard me as a friend receive him as myself.
<sup class="v">1:18</sup>If he injured you, or owes you any thing,
set it to my account. <sup class="v">1:19</sup>I, Paul, have
written with my hand; I will pay; not to tell you that you owe
yourself to me. <sup class="v">1:20</sup>Yes, brother, let me be

<h3>PAUL'S PRAYERS FOR THE COLOSSIANS, THE DIGNITY OF CHRIST,
PAUL'S MINISTRY, FALSE TEACHERS, ETC.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">1:1</sup>PAUL, an apostle of
Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy the brother,
<sup class="v">1:2</sup>to the saints in Colosse and the faithful
brothers in Christ. Grace be to you and peace from God our
Father.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">1:3</sup>We thank the God and
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,
<sup class="v">1:4</sup>having heard of your faith in Christ Jesus
and the love which you have for all the saints, <sup class=
"v">1:5</sup>on account of the hope laid up for you in heaven, of
which you heard before in the true word of the gospel <sup class=
"v">1:6</sup>which is present with you as also in all the world,
and is fruitful and increases, as also with you, from the day that
you heard and knew the grace of God in truth; <sup class=
"v">1:7</sup>as you learned from Epaphras our beloved
fellow-servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ for you,
<sup class="v">1:8</sup>and who made known to us your love in the
Spirit.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">1:9</sup>Therefore we also, from
the day that we heard, cease not to pray for you, and to ask that
you may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and
spiritual understanding, <sup class="v">1:10</sup>that you may walk
worthily of the Lord in all that is pleasing [to him], being
fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God;
<sup class="v">1:11</sup>being strengthened with all power,
according to his glorious power, for all patience and long
suffering with joy; <sup class="v">1:12</sup>giving thanks to the
Father who has made us fit for a portion in the inheritance of the
saints in light, <sup class="v">1:13</sup>who delivered us from the
power of darkness and translated us into the kingdom of the Son of
his love, <sup class="v">1:14</sup>in whom we have redemption, the
forgiveness of sins, <sup class="v">1:15</sup>who is the likeness
of the invisible God, the first-born of all creation, <sup class=
"v">1:16</sup>for by him were all things created which are in
heaven and on the earth, the visible and the invisible, whether
thrones, or lordships, or principalities, or powers. All things
were created through him and for him, <sup class="v">1:17</sup>and
he is before all things, and in him all things consist, <sup class=
"v">1:18</sup>and he is the head of the body, the church; who is
the beginning, the first-born from the dead, that he might himself
be preeminent in all things, <sup class="v">1:19</sup>for in him
[God] was well pleased that all fullness should dwell, <sup class=
"v">1:20</sup>and through him to reconcile all things to himself,
making peace through the blood of his cross, through him, whether
things on the earth or things in the heavens. <sup class=
"v">1:21</sup>And you, formerly alienated and enemies in mind by
evil works, he has now reconciled <sup class="v">1:22</sup>by the
body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and without
blame and without fault before him, <sup class="v">1:23</sup>if
indeed you continue founded and established in the faith, and not
moved from the hope of the gospel which you heard, which was
preached in all the creation under heaven; of which I, Paul, was
made a minister.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">1:24</sup>Now I rejoice in
sufferings for you, and supply the deficiencies of the afflictions
of Christ in my flesh for his body, which is the church,
<sup class="v">1:25</sup>of which I was made a minister according
to the dispensation of God given me for you, to complete the word
of God, <sup class="v">1:26</sup>the mystery concealed from ages
and from generations, but now it has been manifested to his saints,
<sup class="v">1:27</sup>to whom God was pleased to make known what
is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the nations, which
is Christ in you, the hope of glory, <sup class="v">1:28</sup>whom
we preach, admonishing every man and teaching every man in all
wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ;
<sup class="v">1:29</sup>for which I also labor, striving with his
power which operates in me with power.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">2:1</sup>For I wish you to know
what a conflict I have for you and those in Laodicea, and as many
as have not seen my face in the flesh, <sup class="v">2:2</sup>that
your hearts may be comforted, being united in love and [raised] to
all the riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the
knowledge of the mystery of God, <sup class="v">2:3</sup>in which
are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. <sup class=
"v">2:4</sup>But I say this that no one may mislead you with
persuasive words. <sup class="v">2:5</sup>For if I am absent in the
flesh, still I am present in spirit with you, rejoicing and
beholding your order and the strength of your faith in Christ.
<sup class="v">2:6</sup>As therefore you have received Christ Jesus
the Lord, walk in him, <sup class="v">2:7</sup>founded and built up
in him, and established in the faith as you were taught, abounding
in thanksgiving.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">2:8</sup>See that no one leads
you off as a prey through philosophy and vain deceit, according to
the tradition of men, according to the rudiments of the world, and
not according to Christ, <sup class="v">2:9</sup>for in him dwells
all the fullness of the Deity bodily <sup class="v">2:10</sup>and
you are made perfect in him, who is the head of all principality
and power, <sup class="v">2:11</sup>in whom you are also
circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, with the
putting off of the body of the flesh, with the circumcision of
Christ, <sup class="v">2:12</sup>having been buried with him in
baptism, in which you have also been raised together through the
effectual faith of God who raised him from the dead; <sup class=
"v">2:13</sup>and you being dead in sins and in the uncircumcision
of your flesh, he has made you alive with him, having forgiven us
all sins, <sup class="v">2:14</sup>having blotted out what was
written by the hand in ordinances which was against us, and has
taken it away from between [us], having nailed it to the cross;
<sup class="v">2:15</sup>[and] having subjugated principalities and
powers, he made a public exhibition of them, leading them in
triumph by it.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">2:16</sup>Let no man therefore
judge you in eating and in drinking, or in respect to a feast, or
new moon, or sabbath, <sup class="v">2:17</sup>which are a shadow
of things that were to come; but the body is Christ's. <sup class=
"v">2:18</sup>Let no one wishing [it] deprive you of your reward by
humility and a worship of angels, intruding into what he has not
seen, vainly puffed up by his carnal mind, <sup class=
"v">2:19</sup>and not holding the head, from which all the body
being supplied and compacted by means of joints and tendons grows
with an increase of God. <sup class="v">2:20</sup>If therefore you
died with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why do you
practice ordinances as living in the world,&mdash; <sup class=
"v">2:21</sup>you shall not touch, you shall not taste, you shall
not feel,&mdash; <sup class="v">2:22</sup>all which are to perish
in the using&mdash;according to the commandments and instructions
of men? <sup class="v">2:23</sup>Which have an appearance of wisdom
in voluntary worship and humiliation, and in a rigorous treatment
of the body, [which is held] in no respect for the surfeiting of
the flesh.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<h3>MORAL DUTIES, ETC.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">3:1</sup>IF you, therefore, have
been raised with Christ, seek the things above, where Christ sits
on the right hand of God; <sup class="v">3:2</sup>employ your minds
on things above, not on things on the earth. <sup class=
"v">3:3</sup>For you have died, and your life is hid with Christ in
God; <sup class="v">3:4</sup>when Christ your life shall be made
manifest, then shall you also be made manifest in glory.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">3:5</sup>Put to death, therefore,
your members which are on the earth, fornication, impurity,
passion, evil desire, and covetousness which is idolatry,
<sup class="v">3:6</sup>for which comes the wrath of God.
<sup class="v">3:7</sup>In which also you walked formerly when you
lived in them; <sup class="v">3:8</sup>but now do you put away also
all these, anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, vile conversation out
of your mouth; <sup class="v">3:9</sup>lie not one to another; put
off the old man with his doings, <sup class="v">3:10</sup>and put
on the new man, renewed in knowledge in the likeness of him that
created him, <sup class="v">3:11</sup>where there are not Greek and
Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, servant,
freeman, but Christ is all things and in all.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">3:12</sup>Put on, therefore, as
elect and beloved saints of God, hearts of compassion, kindness,
humility, meekness, long-suffering, <sup class=
"v">3:13</sup>forbearing one another, and forgiving one another if
any one has a charge against any, as Christ forgave you, so [do]
you also, <sup class="v">3:14</sup>and in addition to all these
[put on] love, which is the bond of perfection. <sup class=
"v">3:15</sup>And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, for
which you have been called in one body; and be thankful.
<sup class="v">3:16</sup>Let the word of Christ dwell in you
richly, teaching with all wisdom, and admonishing one another, with
psalms, hymns, spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts
to God, <sup class="v">3:17</sup>and whatever you do in word or in
work, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to the
God [and] Father through him.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">3:18</sup>Wives, be subject to
the husbands, as is fit in the Lord. <sup class=
"v">3:19</sup>Husbands, love the wives and be not bitter to them.
<sup class="v">3:20</sup>Children, obey [your] parents in all
things; for this is well pleasing in the Lord. <sup class=
"v">3:21</sup>Fathers, be not fault-finding with your children,
that they be not discouraged. <sup class="v">3:22</sup>Servants,
obey in all things masters according to the flesh, not with eye
service, as those pleasing men, but with a sincere heart, fearing
the Lord. <sup class="v">3:23</sup>And whatever you do, work
heartily, as for the Lord and not for men; <sup class=
"v">3:24</sup>knowing that you will receive from the Lord the
recompense of the inheritance. You serve Christ the Lord;
<sup class="v">3:25</sup>for he that does wrong shall receive for
the wrong which he has done, and there is no respect of persons.
<sup class="v">4:1</sup>Masters, render to your servants what is
just and equal, knowing also that you have a master in heaven.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">4:2</sup>Be constant in prayer,
watching in it with thanksgiving, <sup class="v">4:3</sup>praying
also at the same time for us, that God will open to us a door of
utterance to declare the mystery of Christ, for which also I am
bound, <sup class="v">4:4</sup>that I may declare it plainly, as I
ought to speak. <sup class="v">4:5</sup>Walk in wisdom towards
those without, redeeming the time. <sup class="v">4:6</sup>Let your
words always be with kindness, seasoned with salt, that you may
know how to answer every one.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">4:7</sup>Tychicus will inform you
of all things relating to me, who is a beloved brother, and
faithful minister, and fellow-servant in the Lord, <sup class=
"v">4:8</sup>whom I have sent to you for this purpose, that he may
know your affairs and comfort your hearts, <sup class=
"v">4:9</sup>with Onesimus the faithful and beloved brother, who is
of you; they will tell you of all things here.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">4:10</sup>Aristarchus my
fellow-prisoner salutes you, and Mark the nephew of
Barnabas,&mdash;concerning whom you received commandments, if he
comes to you receive him,&mdash; <sup class="v">4:11</sup>and Jesus
called Justus, who are of the circumcision; these are the only
co-laborers for the kingdom of God who have been a comfort to me.
<sup class="v">4:12</sup>Epaphras, who is of you, a servant of
Christ Jesus, salutes you, always striving for you in prayers that
you may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.
<sup class="v">4:13</sup>For I bear him witness that he has great
zeal for you and for those in Laodicea, and for those in
Hierapolis. <sup class="v">4:14</sup>Luke the beloved physician,
and Demas, salute you. <sup class="v">4:15</sup>Salute the brothers
in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the assembly at his house.
<sup class="v">4:16</sup>And when this letter has been read with
you, cause that it be also read by the church of the Laodiceans;
and do you also read that from Laodicea. <sup class=
"v">4:17</sup>And say to Archippus, Attend to your ministry which
you received in the Lord, to perform it fully. <sup class=

bonds. The grace be with you.</p>

every impurity with greediness. <sup class="v">4:20</sup>But you
have not so learned Christ, <sup class="v">4:21</sup>if you have

"v">4:28</sup>Let him that has stolen steal no more, but rather let
him labor, doing that which is good with his hands, that he may
have to give to him that needs. <sup class="v">4:29</sup>Let no
evil word proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good for
useful edification, that it may afford benefit to those that hear.
<sup class="v">4:30</sup>And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, by
which you were sealed to the day of redemption. <sup class=
"v">4:31</sup>Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamor,
and blasphemy, be banished from among you, with all malice.
<sup class="v">4:32</sup>But be kind one to another, merciful,
giving one to another, as God also in Christ gave to you.
<sup class="v">5:1</sup>Be therefore followers of God, as dear
children, <sup class="v">5:2</sup>and walk in love, as Christ also
loved us and gave himself for us, an offering and sacrifice to God
of good odor.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">5:3</sup>Let not fornication and
any impurity or covetousness be named among you, as becomes saints,
<sup class="v">5:4</sup>nor indecorum and foolish talking, or
jesting, things not becoming, but rather giving of thanks.
<sup class="v">5:5</sup>For you know this, that no fornicator, or
impure, or covetous person, who is an idolater, has an inheritance
in the kingdom of Christ and of God. <sup class="v">5:6</sup>Let no
man deceive you with vain words; for on account of these comes the
wrath of God on the children of disobedience. <sup class=
"v">5:7</sup>Be not therefore partakers with them. <sup class=
"v">5:8</sup>For you were formerly darkness, but now you are light
in the Lord. Walk as children of light,&mdash; <sup class=
"v">5:9</sup>for the fruit of the light is in all goodness and
righteousness and truth,&mdash; <sup class="v">5:10</sup>proving
what is well pleasing to the Lord, <sup class="v">5:11</sup>and be
not partakers of the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather
reprove them. <sup class="v">5:12</sup>For the things which are
done by them in secret it is base even to mention; <sup class=
"v">5:13</sup>but all things proved to be wrong are made manifest
by the light; for every thing which makes manifest is light.
<sup class="v">5:14</sup>Wherefore he says, Awake you that sleep,
and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give you light.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">5:15</sup>See then that you walk
discreetly, not as unwise but as wise, <sup class=
"v">5:16</sup>redeeming the time, because the days are evil.
<sup class="v">5:17</sup>Be not foolish therefore, but understand
what the will of the Lord is. <sup class="v">5:18</sup>And be not
drunk with wine, in which is excess, but be filled with the spirit,
<sup class="v">5:19</sup>speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns
and spiritual songs, singing and making music in your hearts to the
Lord, <sup class="v">5:20</sup>giving thanks always for all things
in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to the God and Father,
<sup class="v">5:21</sup>being subject one to another in the fear
of Christ. <sup class="v">5:22</sup>Let wives [be subject] to their
husbands as to the Lord, <sup class="v">5:23</sup>for the husband
is the head of the wife, as also Christ is the head of the church;
he is the savior of the body. <sup class="v">5:24</sup>But as the
church is subject to Christ, so also let wives be subject to
husbands in every thing. <sup class="v">5:25</sup>Husbands, love
your wives as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it,
<sup class="v">5:26</sup>that he might sanctify it, purifying it
with the washing of water with the word, <sup class=
"v">5:27</sup>that he might present the church to himself glorious,
not having a spot or wrinkle or any thing of the kind, but that it
should be holy and blameless. <sup class="v">5:28</sup>Husbands
ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loves his
wife loves himself; <sup class="v">5:29</sup>for no one ever hated
his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, as Christ also the
church; <sup class="v">5:30</sup>for we are members of his body.
<sup class="v">5:31</sup>For this cause a man shall leave his
father and mother and be joined to his wife, and they two shall be
one flesh. <sup class="v">5:32</sup>This is a great mystery; but I
speak of Christ and the church. <sup class="v">5:33</sup>But do you
also, individually, each one so love his wife as himself, and the
wife [see] that she reverences the husband.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">6:1</sup>Children, obey your
parents in the Lord; for this is right. <sup class=
"v">6:2</sup>Honor your father and your mother, which is the first
commandment with a promise, <sup class="v">6:3</sup>that it may be
well with you, and you shall live long in the land. <sup class=
"v">6:4</sup>And, fathers, provoke not your children, but bring
them up in the instruction and admonition of the Lord.</p>
<p class="pin">8 <sup class="v">6:5</sup>Servants, be subject to
masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in the
sincerity of your hearts as to Christ, <sup class="v">6:6</sup>not
with eye service as pleasing men, but as servants of Christ doing
the will of God from the heart, <sup class="v">6:7</sup>performing
service kindly as to the Lord and not to men, <sup class=
"v">6:8</sup>knowing that whatever good each one does, for this he
shall receive from the Lord, whether a servant or a freeman.
<sup class="v">6:9</sup>And, masters, do the same things to them,
forbearing threatening, knowing also that their master and yours is
in heaven, and there is no respect of persons with him.</p>
<p class="pin">9 <sup class="v">6:10</sup>Finally, be strong in
the Lord and in the power of his might. <sup class=
"v">6:11</sup>Put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to
stand against the wiles of the devil; <sup class="v">6:12</sup>for
our conflict is not against flesh and blood, but against
principalities, against powers, against the potentates of the
darkness of this world, against the spiritual [hosts] of evil in
the heavenly [worlds]. <sup class="v">6:13</sup>Take therefore the
whole armor of God, that you may be able to resist in the evil day,
and having done all to stand. <sup class="v">6:14</sup>Stand,
therefore, girded about your loins with truth, and having put on
the cuirass of righteousness, <sup class="v">6:15</sup>and bound
your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace; <sup class=
"v">6:16</sup>over all, taking the shield of the faith, with which
you may be able to extinguish all the fiery darts of evil.
<sup class="v">6:17</sup>And take the helmet of salvation, and the
sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, <sup class=
"v">6:18</sup>praying with all prayer and supplication on every
occasion with the spirit, and watching in the same with all
perseverance and supplication for all the saints, <sup class=
"v">6:19</sup>and for me, that a word may be given me at the
opening of my mouth boldly to make known the mystery of the gospel,
<sup class="v">6:20</sup>in behalf of which I perform an embassy in
bonds, that I may speak boldly in them, as I ought to speak.</p>
<p class="pin">10 <sup class="v">6:21</sup>But that you may also
know the things concerning me, how I do, Tichycus the beloved
brother and faithful minister in the Lord will inform you of all
things; <sup class="v">6:22</sup>whom I have sent to you for this
purpose, that you may know the things concerning us and that he may
comfort your hearts. <sup class="v">6:23</sup>Peace and love be to
the brothers with faith, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus
Christ. <sup class="v">6:24</sup>The grace be with all who love our
Lord Jesus Christ with constancy.</p>

<h3>ROME, A.D. 63. (ACTS, 25:4.)</h3>
<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>
<h3>PAUL'S LOVE FOR THE PHILIPPIANS, AFFAIRS AT ROME, MORAL DUTIES,
ETC.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">1:1</sup>PAUL and Timothy,
servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus at
Philippi, with the bishops and deacons. <sup class=
"v">1:2</sup>Grace be to you and peace from God our Father and the
Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">1:3</sup>I thank my God at every
remembrance of you, <sup class="v">1:4</sup>always in every prayer
of mine for you all making request with joy, <sup class=
"v">1:5</sup>for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day
till now, <sup class="v">1:6</sup>having this same confidence, that
he who has begun a good work in you will carry it on till the day
of Jesus Christ, <sup class="v">1:7</sup>as it is right for me to
think this of you all, because I have you in my heart, both in my
bonds and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, you being
all partakers of my grace. <sup class="v">1:8</sup>For God is my
witness, how much I desire you all with the tender affections of
Christ Jesus. <sup class="v">1:9</sup>And this I pray, that your
love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and all
understanding, <sup class="v">1:10</sup>that you may prove the
excellent, that you may be without fault and without offense in the
day of Christ, <sup class="v">1:11</sup>filled with the fruit of
righteousness, through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of
God.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">1:12</sup>But I wish you to know,
brothers, that the things as to me have resulted in the advancement
of the gospel, <sup class="v">1:13</sup>so that my bonds in Christ
are manifest in all the Pr&aelig;torium and in all other places,
<sup class="v">1:14</sup>and many of the brothers having been made
confident by my bonds in the Lord have more abundant courage to
speak the word without fear. <sup class="v">1:15</sup>For some
indeed preach Christ because of envy and strife, and some also
because of good will; <sup class="v">1:17</sup>those from love,
knowing that I am set for the defense of the gospel, <sup class=
"v">1:16</sup>but those from contention preach Christ not
sincerely, thinking to raise up affliction for my bonds.
<sup class="v">1:18</sup>What then? nevertheless, in every way,
whether in pretence or in truth, Christ is preached, and in this I
rejoice. But I also will rejoice; <sup class="v">1:19</sup>for I
know that this will result in salvation to me, through your prayer,
and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, <sup class=
"v">1:20</sup>according to my expectation and hope that I shall be
ashamed in nothing, but with all boldness as always also now Christ
shall be magnified in my body, whether by life or by death.
<sup class="v">1:21</sup>Because for me to live is Christ and to
die is gain. <sup class="v">1:22</sup>But if to live in the flesh
[is allowed me], I have this fruit of my work, and which I shall
choose I know not. <sup class="v">1:23</sup>But I am in a strait
between the two, having a desire to depart and be with Christ; for
this is far better; <sup class="v">1:24</sup>but to continue in the
flesh is more necessary for you. <sup class="v">1:25</sup>And fully
believing this, I know that I shall continue, and continue with you
all, for your advancement and joy of the faith, <sup class=
"v">1:26</sup>that your rejoicing may abound in Christ Jesus by me
through my coming again to you.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">1:27</sup>Only conduct yourselves
as citizens worthily of the gospel of Christ, that whether I come
and see you, or be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that you
stand firm in one spirit, striving together with one mind for the
faith of the gospel, <sup class="v">1:28</sup>terrified in nothing
by the adversaries, which is to them a token of destruction, but to
you of salvation, and this from God; <sup class=
"v">1:29</sup>because it was given to you in behalf of Christ, not
only to believe on him but also to suffer for him, <sup class=
"v">1:30</sup>having the same conflict which you saw in me and now
hear of in me.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">2:1</sup>If therefore there is
any consolation in Christ, if any comfort in love, if any
participation of the Spirit, if any affections and compassions,
<sup class="v">2:2</sup>fulfil my joy, that you have the same mind,
having the same love, sympathizing with each other, having one
opinion. <sup class="v">2:3</sup>Do nothing in strife or vain
glory, but in humility let each esteem others better than himself,
<sup class="v">2:4</sup>and let each consider not his own
interests, but also those of others. <sup class="v">2:5</sup>Let
this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus, <sup class=
"v">2:6</sup>who being in the form of God thought it not a robbery
to be equal with God; <sup class="v">2:7</sup>but he abased
himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness
of man, <sup class="v">2:8</sup>and being found in form like a man,
he humbled himself, and became obedient even till death, and the
death of the cross. <sup class="v">2:9</sup>Wherefore God also
highly exalted him, and gave him a name which is above every name,
<sup class="v">2:10</sup>that at the name of Jesus every knee shall
bow, of beings in heaven and in the earth and under the earth,
<sup class="v">2:11</sup>and every tongue shall confess that Jesus
Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">2:12</sup>And so, my beloved, as
you always obeyed, not in my presence only, but now much more in my
absence, work out your salvation with fear and trembling;
<sup class="v">2:13</sup>for God works in you both to will and to
work of his good pleasure. <sup class="v">2:14</sup>Do all things
without complainings and disputations, <sup class=
"v">2:15</sup>that you may be blameless and sincere, children of
God without blame in the midst of a crooked and perverse
generation, in which you shine as luminaries in the world,
<sup class="v">2:16</sup>holding fast the word of life, for my
glorying in the day of Christ, that I did not run in vain, nor
labor in vain. <sup class="v">2:17</sup>But if I am even poured out
as a libation on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice
and congratulate you all; <sup class="v">2:18</sup>do you also
rejoice with the same joy and congratulate me.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">2:19</sup>But I hope in the Lord
Jesus to send Timothy to you shortly, that I may be refreshed when
I know your affairs. <sup class="v">2:20</sup>For I have no one
like minded who really will care for your interests; <sup class=
"v">2:21</sup>for all seek their own, not the things of Jesus
Christ. <sup class="v">2:22</sup>But you know his tried virtue,
that as a son with a father he has served with me in the gospel.
<sup class="v">2:23</sup>Him therefore I hope to send to you as
soon as I know how it will be with me; <sup class="v">2:24</sup>and
I hope in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.</p>
<p class="pin">8 <sup class="v">2:25</sup>But I thought it
necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, the brother and my
fellow-laborer and fellow-soldier, but your apostle and servant of
my need, <sup class="v">2:26</sup>for he greatly desired you all
and was anxious, because you heard that he was sick. <sup class=
"v">2:27</sup>For indeed he was sick nigh to death; but God had
mercy on him, and not on him only but on me also, lest I should
have sorrow upon sorrow. <sup class="v">2:28</sup>I have sent him
therefore the more diligently, that seeing him again you may
rejoice and I be less sorrowful. <sup class="v">2:29</sup>Receive
him therefore in the Lord with all joy, and have such in
estimation, <sup class="v">2:30</sup>because on account of the work
he was nigh to death, not having consulted properly for his life,
that he might fully supply your lack of service to me.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<h3>JUDAIZING TEACHERS, EXHORTATIONS, ACKNOWLEDGMENTS, ETC.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">3:1</sup>FINALLY, my brothers,
rejoice in the Lord; for to write the same things to you is not
grievous to me, and is safe for you. <sup class="v">3:2</sup>Beware
of the dogs, beware of evil laborers, beware of the concision.
<sup class="v">3:3</sup>We are the circumcision, who serve God in
spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and trust not in the flesh,
<sup class="v">3:4</sup>although I have ground of confidence in the
flesh. If any other one thinks he may trust in the flesh, I [may]
more; <sup class="v">3:5</sup>circumcised the eighth day, of the
race of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of the Hebrews,
as to the law a Pharisee, <sup class="v">3:6</sup>as to zeal
persecuting the church, as to righteousness by the law being
blameless. <sup class="v">3:7</sup>But whatever things were my
gain, these I have considered a loss for the sake of Christ.
<sup class="v">3:8</sup>But for the same reason also I consider all
things to be a loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge
of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have suffered the loss of
all things, and consider them worthless that I may gain Christ
<sup class="v">3:9</sup>and be found in him, not having my
righteousness by the law, but that which is through the faith of
Christ, the righteousness of God by the faith, <sup class=
"v">3:10</sup>that I may know him, and the power of his
resurrection, and the participation of his sufferings, being
conformed to his death, <sup class="v">3:11</sup>that I may attain
the resurrection from the dead. <sup class="v">3:12</sup>Not that I
have already obtained it, or have been already made perfect; but I
follow on that I may attain that for which also I was arrested by
Christ. <sup class="v">3:13</sup>I consider not myself, brothers,
to have attained it; but this one thing I do; forgetting the things
behind, and reaching forward to those before, <sup class=
"v">3:14</sup>I press forward to the mark for the prize of the high
call of God in Christ Jesus. <sup class="v">3:15</sup>Let us, as
many as are perfect therefore, be of this mind; and if any one
thinks at all otherwise, God shall also reveal this to you;
<sup class="v">3:16</sup>but in what we have attained, in this let
us walk.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">3:17</sup>Be followers of me,
brothers, and observe those who walk so as you have us for an
example. <sup class="v">3:18</sup>For many walk, of whom I told you
often and now also tell you weeping, that they are enemies of the
cross of Christ; <sup class="v">3:19</sup>whose end is destruction,
whose God is their stomach, and their glory in their shame; who
regard earthly things. <sup class="v">3:20</sup>But our kingdom is
in heaven, from which also we expect the Saviour, the Lord Jesus
Christ, <sup class="v">3:21</sup>who will change our humble body,
and make it like his glorious body, by the power by which he is
able also to subject all things to himself. <sup class=
"v">4:1</sup>So, my beloved and much desired brothers, my joy and
crown, so stand firm in the Lord, beloved.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">4:2</sup>I beseech Euodias and I
beseech Syntyche to have the same mind in the Lord. <sup class=
"v">4:3</sup>Yes, I beseech you also, faithful yoke-fellow, help
those women who strove in the gospel with me, with Clement and the
rest of my co-laborers, whose names are in the book of life.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">4:4</sup>Rejoice in the Lord
always; again I say, rejoice. <sup class="v">4:5</sup>Let your
gentleness be known to all men; the Lord is near. <sup class=
"v">4:6</sup>Be anxious for nothing, but with all prayer and
supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to
God. <sup class="v">4:7</sup>And may the peace of God which passes
all understanding keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">4:8</sup>Finally, brothers,
whatever things are true, whatever things are honorable, whatever
things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are
lovely, whatever things are reputable, if there is any virtue, and
if there is any praise, consider these things; <sup class=
"v">4:9</sup>and what you learned and received and heard and knew
in me, these things do; and the God of peace shall be with you.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">4:10</sup>But I rejoice greatly
in the Lord, that now at length you began again to care for me, for
whom also you did care, but had no opportunity [to serve me].
<sup class="v">4:11</sup>Not that I speak of want; for I have
learned in whatever circumstances I am to be contented. <sup class=
"v">4:12</sup>I know both how to be humbled, and I know how to
abound; in every thing and in all conditions I am instructed both
to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer want.
<sup class="v">4:13</sup>I endure all things with him that
strengthens me. <sup class="v">4:14</sup>But you did well to
communicate with my affliction, <sup class="v">4:15</sup>And you
know also, Philippians, that at the beginning of the gospel, when I
went out from Macedonia, no church communicated with me in the
matter of giving and receiving except you only; <sup class=
"v">4:16</sup>for even in Thessalonica and once and again you sent
to my need. <sup class="v">4:17</sup>Not that I desire a gift, but
I desire the fruit which abounds to your account. <sup class=
"v">4:18</sup>But I have all things and abound, I am fully
supplied, having received from Epaphroditus the things from you, a
perfume of good odor, an acceptable sacrifice, well pleasing to
God. <sup class="v">4:19</sup>And God shall fully supply all your
need, according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus. <sup class=
"v">4:20</sup>To our God and Father be the glory forever and ever;
amen.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">4:21</sup>Salute every saint in
Christ Jesus. The brothers with me salute you. <sup class=
"v">4:22</sup>All the saints salute you, especially those of
C&aelig;sar's family. <sup class="v">4:23</sup>The grace of the
Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirits.</p>

<h3>PHILIPPI, A.D. 64.</h3>
<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>
<h3>A CHARGE TO TITUS IN RESPECT TO HIS MINISTRY.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">1:1</sup>PAUL, a servant of God,
and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's
elect, and the knowledge of the truth which is according to piety,
<sup class="v">1:2</sup>for the hope of eternal life, which God who
cannot lie announced before eternal ages, <sup class=
"v">1:3</sup>but manifested his word in the times which were
suitable for it by the preaching with which I was intrusted,
according to the command of our Saviour God, <sup class=
"v">1:4</sup>to Titus my faithful son in the common faith; grace
and peace from God the Father, and Christ Jesus our Saviour.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">1:5</sup>For this cause I left
you in Crete, that you might regulate things which are deficient,
and appoint elders in every city, as I charged you, <sup class=
"v">1:6</sup>if any one is blameless, a husband of one wife, having
faithful children, not accused of intemperance or of
insubordination. <sup class="v">1:7</sup>For a bishop must be
blameless as a steward of God, not self-indulgent, not soon angry,
not given to wine, not contentious, not devoted to base gain,
<sup class="v">1:8</sup>but a lover of hospitality, kind, sober,
just, holy, self-denying, <sup class="v">1:9</sup>holding firmly
the faithful word taught, that he may be able both to exhort with
sound instruction and to convince those who contradict. <sup class=
"v">1:10</sup>For there are many disorderly wranglers and
deceivers, especially those of the circumcision, <sup class=
"v">1:11</sup>whom it is necessary to silence, who mislead whole
families, teaching for base gain what they ought not.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">1:12</sup>A certain one of them,
their own poet, said, Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy
gormandizers. <sup class="v">1:13</sup>This testimony is true.
Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,
<sup class="v">1:14</sup>not attending to Jewish myths, and
commandments of men who subvert the truth. <sup class=
"v">1:15</sup>To the pure all things are pure; but to the defiled
and unbelieving, nothing is pure; but their mind and conscience are
defiled. <sup class="v">1:16</sup>They profess to know God, but by
works deny him, being abominable and disobedient, and as to every
good work reprobate.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">2:1</sup>Speak things which
become sound teaching. <sup class="v">2:2</sup>That the aged men be
sober, grave, of sound mind, sound in faith, in love, in patience;
<sup class="v">2:3</sup>that the aged women, in like manner, be of
behavior becoming holiness, not slanderers, not enslaved to much
wine, teachers of what is good, <sup class="v">2:4</sup>that they
may instruct the young women to be lovers of their husbands, lovers
of their children, <sup class="v">2:5</sup>sober, pure, fond of
home, kind, subject to their husbands, that the word of God may not
be blasphemed.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">2:6</sup>In like manner exhort
the younger to be of a sound mind, <sup class=
"v">2:7</sup>presenting yourself as an example of good works in all
things, in teaching [exhibiting] integrity, gravity, <sup class=
"v">2:8</sup>sound argument not to be condemned, that the adversary
may be ashamed, having nothing evil to say of us. <sup class=
"v">2:9</sup>Let servants be subject to their masters, please them
in all things, not contradicting, <sup class="v">2:10</sup>not
pilfering, but showing all good fidelity, that they may adorn the
doctrine of our Saviour God in all things.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">2:11</sup>For the grace of God
that pertains to salvation appeared to all men, <sup class=
"v">2:12</sup>teaching us, that denying impiety and worldly desires
we should live soberly, and righteously, and piously in the present
life, <sup class="v">2:13</sup>looking for the blessed hope and
appearing of the glory of the great God and of our Saviour Jesus
Christ, <sup class="v">2:14</sup>who gave himself for us, that he
might redeem us from all wickedness, and purify for himself a
peculiar people, zealous of good works.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">2:15</sup>These things speak, and
exhort, and reprove with all authority; let no man despise you.
<sup class="v">3:1</sup>Admonish them to be subject to
principalities, to powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready for
every good work, <sup class="v">3:2</sup>to speak evil of no one,
to be peaceable, gentle, showing all meekness to all men.
<sup class="v">3:3</sup>For we formerly were foolish, disobedient,
deceived, serving various desires and pleasures, living in malice
and envy, detestable, and hating one another; <sup class=
"v">3:4</sup>but when the goodness and philanthropy of the Saviour
our God appeared, <sup class="v">3:5</sup>not by works of
righteousness which we did but according to his mercy he saved us
through the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy
Spirit, <sup class="v">3:6</sup>which he poured out on us richly
through Jesus Christ our Saviour; <sup class="v">3:7</sup>that
having been justified by his grace we should become heirs according
to the hope of eternal life. <sup class="v">3:8</sup>The word is
true, and I wish you to insist strongly concerning these things,
that those who have believed in God may be careful to maintain good
works. For these things are honorable and useful to men.
<sup class="v">3:9</sup>But foolish questions, and genealogies, and
strifes and contentions about the law, avoid; for they are
unprofitable and vain. <sup class="v">3:10</sup>A man that is a
heretic, after the first and second admonition, reject, <sup class=
"v">3:11</sup>knowing that such a one is subverted, and sins, being
self-condemned.</p>
<p class="pin">8 <sup class="v">3:12</sup>When I send you
Artemas, or Tychicus, make haste to come to me at Nicopolis; for
there I have determined to spend the winter. <sup class=
"v">3:13</sup>Send forward Zenas the lawyer and Apollos with
diligence, and let nothing be wanting to them; <sup class=
"v">3:14</sup>and let ours also learn to maintain good works for
necessary purposes, that they may not be unfruitful. <sup class=
"v">3:15</sup>All who are with me salute you. Salute those who love
us in the faith. The grace be with you all.</p>

<h3>PHILIPPI, A.D. 65.</h3>
<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>
<h3>A CHARGE TO TIMOTHY CONCERNING THE GOSPEL, PUBLIC PRAYER, AND
THE DUTIES OF WOMEN.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">1:1</sup>PAUL, an apostle of
Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Saviour and Christ Jesus
our hope, <sup class="v">1:2</sup>to Timothy my true son in the
faith; grace, mercy, and peace from God our Father and Christ Jesus
our Lord.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">1:3</sup>As I requested you to
remain at Ephesus, when going into Macedonia, that you might charge
some not to preach another doctrine, <sup class="v">1:4</sup>nor
attend to myths or interminable genealogies, which occasion
disputes rather than a dispensation of God by faith, [do.]
<sup class="v">1:5</sup>But the end of the commandment is love from
a pure heart and good conscience and faith unfeigned, <sup class=
"v">1:6</sup>which some having missed turned aside to vain words,
<sup class="v">1:7</sup>desiring to be teachers of the law, not
understanding what they say nor about what they make confident
assertions. <sup class="v">1:8</sup>But we know that the law is
good if one uses it lawfully; <sup class="v">1:9</sup>knowing this,
that a law is not made for a righteous man, but for the wicked and
disorderly, the impious and sinful, the unholy and profane,
murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers and murderers of
their fellow-men, <sup class="v">1:10</sup>fornicators, sodomites,
men-stealers, liars, perjurers, and whatever else is contrary to
sound doctrine, <sup class="v">1:11</sup>according to the glorious
gospel of the blessed God, with which I have been intrusted.
<sup class="v">1:12</sup>And I thank our Lord Jesus Christ who has
empowered me [to preach,] that he accounted me faithful, putting me
in the ministry, <sup class="v">1:13</sup>who formerly was a
blasphemer and persecutor and an injurious man; but I obtained
mercy because I did those things ignorantly in unbelief;
<sup class="v">1:14</sup>and the grace of our Lord greatly abounded
with the faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. <sup class=
"v">1:15</sup>The word is true and worthy of all acceptation, that
Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am
chief; <sup class="v">1:16</sup>but on this account I obtained
mercy, that Jesus Christ might exhibit in me first all
long-suffering, for an example to those who should hereafter
believe in him to life eternal. <sup class="v">1:17</sup>And to the
King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory
forever and ever; amen.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">1:18</sup>This charge I commit to
you, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before
concerning you, that by them you may perform an honorable service,
<sup class="v">1:19</sup>having faith and a good conscience, which
some having cast away have suffered shipwreck of the faith;
<sup class="v">1:20</sup>of whom are Hymen&aelig;us and Alexander,
whom I delivered to Satan, that they may learn not to
blaspheme.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">2:1</sup>I exhort therefore,
first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings
should be offered for all men, <sup class="v">2:2</sup>for kings
and all in authority, that we may lead quiet and peaceful lives in
all piety and sanctity. <sup class="v">2:3</sup>For this is good
and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour, <sup class=
"v">2:4</sup>who wishes all men to be saved and to come to a
knowledge of truth. <sup class="v">2:5</sup>For there is one God,
and one mediator of God and man, the man Christ Jesus, <sup class=
"v">2:6</sup>who gave himself a ransom for all, a testimony for its
own times, <sup class="v">2:7</sup>of which I was made a herald and
an apostle,&mdash;I speak the truth, I lie not,&mdash;a teacher of
nations in faith and truth.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">2:8</sup>I wish also that men
should pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and
disputations; <sup class="v">2:9</sup>and in like manner also, that
women in becoming apparel with modesty and sobriety adorn
themselves, not with plaited hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly
clothing, <sup class="v">2:10</sup>but with good works, which
become women professing godliness. <sup class="v">2:11</sup>Let a
woman learn quietly in all subjection; <sup class="v">2:12</sup>but
I permit not a woman to teach, nor to have authority over a man,
but to be quiet. <sup class="v">2:13</sup>For Adam was first
formed, then Eve. <sup class="v">2:14</sup>And Adam was not
deceived; but the woman being deceived fell into transgression;
<sup class="v">2:15</sup>but she shall be saved through
child-bearing, if they continue in faith, and love, and holiness,
with sobriety.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<h3>THE APPOINTMENT OF MINISTERS, THE DOCTRINES OF THE GOSPEL,
WIDOWS, ELDERS, SERVANTS, ETC.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">3:1</sup>IT is a true saying, If
any one desires an episcopate he desires a good work. <sup class=
"v">3:2</sup>It is necessary therefore that a bishop should be
blameless, a husband of one wife, circumspect, sober, well-behaved,
hospitable, apt to teach, <sup class="v">3:3</sup>not a
wine-drinker, not a quarrelsome man, but gentle, not contentious,
not avaricious, <sup class="v">3:4</sup>ruling well his own house,
having his children in subjection with all dignity,&mdash;
<sup class="v">3:5</sup>but if any one knows not how to rule his
own house, how will he take care of the church of God?&mdash;
<sup class="v">3:6</sup>not a novice, lest being inflated with
pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil. <sup class=
"v">3:7</sup>And he must also have a good name from those without,
that he may not fall into reproach and a snare of the devil.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">3:8</sup>The deacons in like
manner ought to be grave, not double-tongued, not given to much
wine, not devoted to base gain, <sup class="v">3:9</sup>having the
mystery of the faith in a pure conscience. <sup class=
"v">3:10</sup>And let these be proved first, then let them serve,
being found blameless. <sup class="v">3:11</sup>The women in like
manner must be grave, not slanderers, circumspect, faithful in all
things. <sup class="v">3:12</sup>Let the deacons be husbands of one
wife, ruling well their children and their own houses. <sup class=
"v">3:13</sup>For they who exercise the deaconship well, procure
for themselves an honorable standing, and great boldness in the
faith which is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">3:14</sup>These things I write to
you, hoping to come to you shortly; <sup class="v">3:15</sup>but if
I delay, that you may know how you ought to conduct yourself in the
house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and
foundation of the truth. <sup class="v">3:16</sup>And confessedly
great is the mystery of piety; [Christ,] who was manifested in the
flesh, was justified in the spirit, was seen by angels, was
preached to the nations, was believed on in the world, was received
up into glory.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">4:1</sup>But the Spirit says
expressly, that in the last times some shall apostatize from the
faith, attending to lying spirits and doctrines of demons,
<sup class="v">4:2</sup>[misled] by the hypocrisy of false
teachers, whose consciences are cauterized, <sup class=
"v">4:3</sup>who forbid to marry, [command] to abstain from meat,
which God created to be received with thanksgiving by the faithful
and those who know the truth. <sup class="v">4:4</sup>For every
creature of God is good, and nothing to be rejected, [but] to be
received with thanksgiving; <sup class="v">4:5</sup>for it is
sanctified through the word of God and prayer.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">4:6</sup>Suggesting these things
to the brothers, you will be a good minister of Christ Jesus,
nourished with the words of the faith and the good instruction
which you have followed; <sup class="v">4:7</sup>but avoid profane
and silly myths; exercise yourself in piety; <sup class=
"v">4:8</sup>for bodily exercise profits little; but piety is
profitable in all things, having a promise of the present life and
of the life to come. <sup class="v">4:9</sup>It is a faithful
saying, and worthy of all acceptation. <sup class="v">4:10</sup>For
to this end we also labor and suffer reproach, because we hope in
the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, especially of the
faithful.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">4:11</sup>These things command
and teach. <sup class="v">4:12</sup>Let no one despise your youth,
but be an example to the faithful, in word, in conduct, in love, in
faith, in purity. <sup class="v">4:13</sup>Till I come attend to
reading, exhortation, teaching. <sup class="v">4:14</sup>Neglect
not the gift which is in you, which was given you by prophecy, with
the imposition of hands of the eldership. <sup class=
"v">4:15</sup>Study these things, be much in them, that your
improvement may be manifest to all. <sup class="v">4:16</sup>Attend
to yourself, and to teaching; continue in it, for doing this you
will both save yourself and those that hear you.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">5:1</sup>Rebuke not an aged man,
but entreat him as a father, the younger men as brothers,
<sup class="v">5:2</sup>the aged women as mothers, the younger as
sisters, with all purity. <sup class="v">5:3</sup>Support the
widows who are widows indeed. <sup class="v">5:4</sup>But if any
widow has children or relatives, let them learn first to support
their family and to make returns to their parents, for this is
acceptable in the sight of God. <sup class="v">5:5</sup>But one
that is a widow indeed and alone hopes in God, and continues in
petitions and prayers night and day; <sup class="v">5:6</sup>but a
woman that lives voluptuously is dead while she lives. <sup class=
"v">5:7</sup>And command these things, that they be blameless.
<sup class="v">5:8</sup>And if any one provides not for his own,
and especially for those of his own house, he has denied the faith,
and is worse than an unbeliever.</p>
<p class="pin">8 <sup class="v">5:9</sup>Let not a widow be
enrolled under sixty years of age, a wife of one husband,
<sup class="v">5:10</sup>well reputed for good works, if she has
brought up children, if she has exercised hospitality, if she has
washed the saints' feet, if she has relieved the distressed, if she
has pursued every good work. <sup class="v">5:11</sup>But reject
the younger widows; for when they fall into pleasure to the neglect
of Christ, they wish to marry, <sup class="v">5:12</sup>being
condemned because they have rejected the first faith; <sup class=
"v">5:13</sup>and at the same time also, being idle, they learn to
go from house to house, and not only are they idle, they are also
tattlers and mischief makers, saying what they ought not.
<sup class="v">5:14</sup>I wish therefore the younger women to
marry, bear children, keep house, give no occasion of reproach to
the enemy; <sup class="v">5:15</sup>for some have already turned
back after Satan. <sup class="v">5:16</sup>If any faithful man or
faithful woman has widows, let them give them relief, and let not
the church be burdened, that it may be able to relieve those really
widows.</p>
<p class="pin">9 <sup class="v">5:17</sup>Let the elders who rule
well be accounted worthy of a double compensation, especially those
who labor in word and teaching. <sup class="v">5:18</sup>For the
Scripture says, You shall not muzzle the ox that threshes; and, The
laborer is worthy of his reward. <sup class="v">5:19</sup>Against
an elder receive not an accusation, except by two or three
witnesses. <sup class="v">5:20</sup>Those that sin, rebuke before
all, that others also may fear.</p>
<p class="pin">10 <sup class="v">5:21</sup>I charge you before
God, and Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that you keep these
things without prejudice, doing nothing from partiality.
<sup class="v">5:22</sup>Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither
partake of others' sins. Keep yourself pure. <sup class=
"v">5:23</sup>Drink no longer water, but use a little wine on
account of your stomach and your frequent infirmities. <sup class=
"v">5:24</sup>The sins of some men are manifest, going before to
judgment; but some they follow; <sup class="v">5:25</sup>in like
manner also good works are manifest, and those which are otherwise
cannot be hid.</p>
<p class="pin">11 <sup class="v">6:1</sup>Let as many servants as
are under the yoke account their masters worthy of all honor, that
the name and doctrine of God may not be blasphemed. <sup class=
"v">6:2</sup>And let those who have believing masters not despise
them, because they are brothers, but rather serve, because they are
believers and beloved, who partake of the benefit.</p>
<p class="pin">12 These things teach and exhort. <sup class=
"v">6:3</sup>If any one teaches differently, and consents not to
sound words, the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the doctrine
which is according to piety, <sup class="v">6:4</sup>he is blinded
and knows nothing, but has a sickly longing for debates and wars of
words, from which arise envy, contention, blasphemies, evil
suspicions, <sup class="v">6:5</sup>and wranglings of men of
unsound judgments and destitute of the truth, supposing that piety
is gain. <sup class="v">6:6</sup>But piety with contentment is
great gain. <sup class="v">6:7</sup>For we brought nothing into the
world; it is clear that we can carry nothing out of it; <sup class=
"v">6:8</sup>but having food and clothing let us be contented with
them. <sup class="v">6:9</sup>But those who wish to be rich fall
into trial and a snare, and many foolish and injurious desires,
which plunge men into destruction and perdition. <sup class=
"v">6:10</sup>For the love of money is a root of all evils, which
some having desired have been misled from the faith, and pierced
themselves through with many sorrows.</p>
<p class="pin">13 <sup class="v">6:11</sup>But do you, O man of
God, avoid these things; but pursue righteousness, piety, faith,
love, patience, meekness. <sup class="v">6:12</sup>Fight the good
fight of the faith, lay hold on eternal life, to which you were
called and made the good profession before many witnesses.
<sup class="v">6:13</sup>I charge you before the God who gives life
to all [creatures], and Christ Jesus who made the good profession
before Pontius Pilate, <sup class="v">6:14</sup>that you keep the
charge without spot, without blame, till the appearing of our Lord
Jesus Christ, <sup class="v">6:15</sup>which the blessed and only
Potentate will show in its times, the King of kings and Lord of
Lords, <sup class="v">6:16</sup>who only has immortality, dwelling
in light unapproachable, whom no man has seen nor can see; to whom
be honor and power eternal; amen.</p>
<p class="pin">14 <sup class="v">6:17</sup>Charge the rich in the
present life not to be high-minded, nor trust in uncertain riches,
but in the living God who gives us all things richly to enjoy,
<sup class="v">6:18</sup>to perform good works, to be rich in good
works, to be liberal, benevolent, <sup class=
"v">6:19</sup>treasuring up for themselves a good foundation for
the future, that they may lay hold on the true life.</p>
<p class="pin">15 <sup class="v">6:20</sup>O Timothy, keep the
trust, turning away from profane and empty words, and
contradictions of mis-named science, <sup class="v">6:21</sup>which
some having professed have erred from the faith. The grace be with
you.</p>

<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">1:3</sup>I thank God, whom I

incessantly in my prayers night and day, <sup class=

might be filled with joy, <sup class="v">1:5</sup>having a
remembrance of the unfeigned faith in you, which dwelt first in
your grandmother Lois, and your mother Eunice, and I am persuaded
that [it dwells] also in you. <sup class="v">1:6</sup>For which
cause I admonish you to stir up the gift of God which is in you
through the imposition of my hands. <sup class="v">1:7</sup>For God
gave us not a spirit of fear, but of power, and of love, and of a
sound mind.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">1:8</sup>Be not ashamed therefore
of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner, but endure
affliction with us in the gospel according to the power of God,
<sup class="v">1:9</sup>who saved us, and called us with a holy
calling, not according to our works, but according to his purpose
and grace given us in Christ Jesus from eternity, <sup class=
"v">1:10</sup>but made known now through the appearing of our
Saviour Jesus Christ, who destroyed death, and brought life and
immortality to light through the gospel, <sup class=
"v">1:11</sup>of which I was made a herald, and an apostle, and a
teacher of the nations; <sup class="v">1:12</sup>for which cause I
suffer these things; but I am not ashamed; for I know in whom I
have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep my trust to
that day.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">1:13</sup>Retain the form of
sound words which you heard from me in faith and the love in Christ
Jesus. <sup class="v">1:14</sup>Guard the good trust, through the
Holy Spirit which dwells in us. <sup class="v">1:15</sup>You know
this, that all those in Asia left me, of whom are Phygelus and
Hermogenes. <sup class="v">1:16</sup>May the Lord show mercy to the
house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me, and was not
ashamed of my chains, <sup class="v">1:17</sup>but being at Rome he
sought most diligently, and found me. <sup class="v">1:18</sup>The
Lord grant him to find mercy with the Lord in that day. And what
services he performed at Ephesus, you know very well.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">2:1</sup>Do you therefore, my
son, be strong in the grace in Christ Jesus, <sup class=
"v">2:2</sup>and what you heard from me through many witnesses,
these things commit to faithful men, who shall be competent to
teach others also. <sup class="v">2:3</sup>Endure evil as a good
soldier of Jesus Christ. <sup class="v">2:4</sup>No one who serves
as a soldier is involved in the business of life, that he may
please him who has employed him as a soldier. <sup class=
"v">2:5</sup>And if a man contends as an athlete, he is not crowned
unless he contends lawfully. <sup class="v">2:6</sup>The husbandman
who labors must first partake of the fruits of the earth.
<sup class="v">2:7</sup>Consider what I say; for the Lord shall
give you understanding in all things.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">2:8</sup>Remember Jesus Christ
raised from the dead, a descendant of David, according to my
gospel, <sup class="v">2:9</sup>in which I suffer even to chains as
an evil doer; but the word of God is not bound. <sup class=
"v">2:10</sup>Therefore I endure all things for the elect, that
they may obtain the salvation in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.
<sup class="v">2:11</sup>The saying is true, For if we died
together we shall live together; <sup class="v">2:12</sup>if we
endure patiently we shall reign together; if we deny him he will
deny us; <sup class="v">2:13</sup>if we believe not he continues
faithful; for he cannot deny himself.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">2:14</sup>Call to mind these
things, charging [men] before the Lord not to debate about words,
to no profit, to the subversion of the hearers. <sup class=
"v">2:15</sup>Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, a
workman that will not be put to shame, rightly dividing the word of
truth. <sup class="v">2:16</sup>But profane and vain words, avoid;

stands firm, having this seal, The Lord knows them that are his;
and, Let every one who names the name of the Lord depart from
wickedness. <sup class="v">2:20</sup>But in a great house there are
not only vessels of gold and silver, but those also of wood and

<h3>THE LAST TIME, HIS APPROACHING MARTYRDOM, ETC.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">3:1</sup>AND know this, that in

blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,
<sup class="v">3:3</sup>without natural affection, covenant
breakers, slanderers, intemperate, ungentle, despisers of the good,
<sup class="v">3:4</sup>traitors, rash, boasters, lovers of

captive foolish women loaded with sins, and led by various desires,
<sup class="v">3:7</sup>always learning and never able to come to a
knowledge of the truth. <sup class="v">3:8</sup>As Jannes and
Jambres opposed Moses, so also these oppose the truth, men of no
judgment, reprobate in respect to the faith. <sup class=

foolishness shall become manifest to all, as theirs also was.
<sup class="v">3:10</sup>But you have followed my

love, patience, <sup class="v">3:11</sup>persecutions, sufferings,
which befell me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; the great
persecutions which I suffered, and the Lord delivered me from all.
<sup class="v">3:12</sup>And all who will live piously in Christ
Jesus shall be persecuted. <sup class="v">3:13</sup>But evil men

<sup class="v">4:3</sup>for the time will come when they will not
endure sound instruction, but will accumulate for themselves
teachers according to their desires, pleasing their ear,
<sup class="v">4:4</sup>and they will turn away their ears from the
truth, and be turned to myths. <sup class="v">4:5</sup>But do you
be sober in all things, endure evil, do the work of an evangelist,
perform fully your ministry. <sup class="v">4:6</sup>For I am
already being offered, and the time of my departure has come.
<sup class="v">4:7</sup>I have fought the good fight, I have
finished the race, I have kept the faith; <sup class=
"v">4:8</sup>henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of
righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge will give me in
that day, and not me only but all who love his appearing.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">4:9</sup>Make haste to come to me
quickly; <sup class="v">4:10</sup>for Demas forsook me having loved
the present life and went to Thessalonica, Cresces to Galatia,
Titus to Dalmatia; <sup class="v">4:11</sup>Luke only is with me.
Take Mark and bring him with you; for [he will be] useful to me for
service. <sup class="v">4:12</sup>But I sent Tychicus to Ephesus.
<sup class="v">4:13</sup>The cloak which I left at Troas with
Carpus, when you come, bring, and the books, especially the
parchments.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">4:14</sup>Alexander the
coppersmith did me much harm; may the Lord reward him according to
his work. <sup class="v">4:15</sup>And do you beware of him, for he
greatly opposed our words. <sup class="v">4:16</sup>At my first
defense no one stood by me, but all forsook me; may it not be set
to their account; <sup class="v">4:17</sup>but the Lord stood by
me, and strengthened me, that the word should be fully declared by
me, and all the nations should hear, and I was delivered from the
mouth of the lion. <sup class="v">4:18</sup>The Lord will deliver
me from every evil work, and bring me safe to his heavenly kingdom;
to whom be the glory forever and ever; amen.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">4:19</sup>Salute Prisca

 JAMES.</A></h1>
<h3>JERUSALEM, A.D. 61-66.</h3>
<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>
<h3>TRIALS, PRAYER, FAITH AND WORKS.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">1:1</sup>JAMES, a servant of God
and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes in the
dispersion, greeting. <sup class="v">1:2</sup>Account it all joy,
my brothers, when you fall into various trials, <sup class=
"v">1:3</sup>knowing that the trial of your faith produces
patience. <sup class="v">1:4</sup>But let patience have a perfect
work, that you may be perfect and entire, lacking in nothing.
<sup class="v">1:5</sup>And if any one of you lacks wisdom, let him
ask of God, who gives to all liberally and upbraids not, and it
shall be given him. <sup class="v">1:6</sup>But let him ask in
faith, not doubting; for he that doubts is like a wave of the sea,
driven with the wind and agitated. <sup class="v">1:7</sup>For let
not that man think that he shall receive any thing from the Lord,
<sup class="v">1:8</sup>a double-minded man, unstable in all his
ways. <sup class="v">1:9</sup>But let the brother that is humble
rejoice in his exaltation, <sup class="v">1:10</sup>and the rich in
his humiliation, for he shall pass away like a flower of the grass.
<sup class="v">1:11</sup>For the sun rose hot, and withered the
grass, and its flower fell off, and the beauty of its appearance
perished; so also shall the rich man perish in his ways.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">1:12</sup>Blessed is the man who
endures trial, for when proved he shall receive the crown of life,
which the Lord promised to those who love him. <sup class=
"v">1:13</sup>Let no tempted one say, I am tempted by God; for God
is not subject to temptation by evils, and he tempts no one.
<sup class="v">1:14</sup>But every one is tempted when he is drawn
away by his desires, and enticed; <sup class="v">1:15</sup>then the
desire taking effect produces sin, and sin being finished brings
forth death.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">1:16</sup>Be not deceived, my
beloved brothers. <sup class="v">1:17</sup>All good giving, and
every perfect gift, comes down from above, from the Father of
lights, with whom there is no change or shadow of turning.
<sup class="v">1:18</sup>Of his own will begat he us by the word of
truth, that we should be a kind of first fruit of his
creatures.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">1:19</sup>Understand, my beloved
brothers, and let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow
to anger; <sup class="v">1:20</sup>for man's anger performs not
God's righteousness. <sup class="v">1:21</sup>Wherefore, laying
aside all filthiness and abounding vice, receive with meekness the
engrafted word, which is able to save your souls. <sup class=
"v">1:22</sup>But be doers of the word, and not hearers only,
deceiving yourselves. <sup class="v">1:23</sup>For if any one is a
hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man perceiving his
natural face in a glass; <sup class="v">1:24</sup>for he perceived
himself, and went away, and immediately forgot what kind of a man
he was. <sup class="v">1:25</sup>But he that looks into the perfect
law of liberty and continues in it, not being a forgetful hearer
but a doer of work, he shall be blessed in his doing. <sup class=
"v">1:26</sup>But if any one among you thinks he is religious, and
bridles not his tongue, but deceives his mind, that man's religion
is vain. <sup class="v">1:27</sup>Pure religion and undefiled with
the God and Father is this, to visit the orphans and widows in
their affliction, and to keep one's self unspotted from the
world.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">2:1</sup>My brothers, have not
the faith of our glorious Lord Jesus Christ with a respect of
persons. <sup class="v">2:2</sup>For if there comes into your
assembly a man with a gold ring, in splendid clothing, and there
also comes in a poor man in vile clothing, <sup class=
"v">2:3</sup>and you look upon him who wears the splendid clothing,
and say to him, Sit here in a good place, and say to the poor man,
Stand there, or sit under my footstool, <sup class="v">2:4</sup>are
you not condemned in yourselves and judges of evil thoughts?</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">2:5</sup>Hear, my beloved
brothers. Has not God chosen the poor of the world rich in faith
and heirs of the kingdom which he promised to those who love him?
<sup class="v">2:6</sup>But you dishonor the poor. Do not the rich
oppress you and drag you to tribunals? <sup class="v">2:7</sup>And
do they not blaspheme the good name by which you are called?
<sup class="v">2:8</sup>If you keep indeed the royal law according
to the Scripture, You shall love your neighbor as yourself, you do
well; <sup class="v">2:9</sup>but if you respect persons, you
commit sin, convicted by the law as transgressors. <sup class=
"v">2:10</sup>For whoever shall keep the whole law, and offend in
one point, is guilty of all. <sup class="v">2:11</sup>For he that
said, You shall not commit adultery, said also, You shall not kill;
and if you do not commit adultery, but kill, you are a transgressor
of the law. <sup class="v">2:12</sup>So speak and so do, as being
about to be judged by the law of liberty. <sup class=
"v">2:13</sup>For he shall have judgment without mercy who shows
not mercy; mercy rejoices over judgment.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">2:14</sup>What is the profit, my
brothers, if a man says he has faith, but has not works? Can faith
save him? <sup class="v">2:15</sup>And if a brother or sister is
naked, or destitute of daily food, <sup class="v">2:16</sup>and one
of you says to them, Go in peace, be warmed and be filled, but
gives them not the necessary supplies for the body, what is the
profit? <sup class="v">2:17</sup>So also faith, if it has not
works, is dead, being alone. <sup class="v">2:18</sup>But some one
will say, You have faith, and I have works; show me your faith
without works, and I will show you my faith by works. <sup class=
"v">2:19</sup>You believe that there is one God? You do well;
demons also believe and tremble. <sup class="v">2:20</sup>But will
you know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead? <sup class=
"v">2:21</sup>Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when
he offered up Isaac his son on the altar? <sup class=
"v">2:22</sup>You see that faith cooperated with his works, and by
works was faith made perfect, <sup class="v">2:23</sup>and the
Scripture was fulfilled which says, And Abraham believed God and it
was accounted to him a righteousness, and he was called God's
friend. <sup class="v">2:24</sup>You see then that a man is
justified by works and not by faith only. <sup class=
"v">2:25</sup>And in like manner also was not Rahab the harlot
justified by works, when she received the messengers and sent them
out another way? <sup class="v">2:26</sup>For as the body without a
spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<h3>ON CENSORIOUSNESS, WISDOM, CONTENTION, ETC.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">3:1</sup>BE not many of you
teachers, my brothers, knowing that we shall receive a severer
judgment. <sup class="v">3:2</sup>For in many things we all offend;
if one offends not in word he is a perfect man, able to keep in
subjection also the whole body. <sup class="v">3:3</sup>But we put
bits into the mouths of horses that they may obey us, and direct
their whole body; <sup class="v">3:4</sup>behold also the ships,
though of so great size and driven by powerful winds, are directed
by a very small helm wherever the will of the pilot chooses;
<sup class="v">3:5</sup>so also the tongue is a small member and
boasts of great things. Behold, how much wood a little fire
kindles! <sup class="v">3:6</sup>And the tongue is a fire, the
tongue is made a world of wickedness among our members, it defiles
the whole body and sets on fire the course of nature and is set on
fire by hell. <sup class="v">3:7</sup>For every kind of beasts, and
birds, and reptiles, and fishes, is tamed and has been tamed by the
human race, <sup class="v">3:8</sup>but the tongue can no man tame;
it is a disorderly evil, full of a deadly poison. <sup class=
"v">3:9</sup>With it bless we the Lord and Father, and with it
curse we men made in the likeness of God. <sup class=
"v">3:10</sup>Out of the same mouth proceeds a blessing and a
curse. My brothers, these things ought not so to be. <sup class=
"v">3:11</sup>Does a fountain send forth sweet water and bitter
from the same opening? <sup class="v">3:12</sup>Can a fig tree, my
brothers, produce olives, or a vine, figs? So you cannot make salt
water sweet.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">3:13</sup>What wise and
intelligent man is there among you? Let him show his works by good
conduct, in the meekness of wisdom. <sup class="v">3:14</sup>But if
you have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, boast not and
lie not against the truth. <sup class="v">3:15</sup>This wisdom
comes not from above, but is earthly, natural, demoniacal.
<sup class="v">3:16</sup>For where envy and strife are, there are
disorder and every evil work. <sup class="v">3:17</sup>But the
wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, easy to be
persuaded, full of mercy and of good fruits, without partiality,
without hypocrisy. <sup class="v">3:18</sup>And the fruit of
righteousness is sown in peace to those who make peace.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">4:1</sup>Whence come wars and
contentions among you? Come they not thence, from your pleasures
that war in your members? <sup class="v">4:2</sup>You desire and
have not; you kill, and envy, and cannot obtain; you fight and
carry on war. You have not, because you do not ask; <sup class=
"v">4:3</sup>you ask and do not receive, because you ask amiss, to
expend on your pleasures. <sup class="v">4:4</sup>Adulteresses,
know you not that the friendship of the world is enmity against
God? Whoever therefore wishes to be a friend of the world, is made
an enemy of God. <sup class="v">4:5</sup>Or do you suppose that the
Scripture says in vain, The spirit which dwells in us desires to
envy? <sup class="v">4:6</sup>But he gives more grace; wherefore he
says, God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.
<sup class="v">4:7</sup>Be subject therefore to God; resist the
devil and he will flee from you; <sup class="v">4:8</sup>draw nigh
to God and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, sinners,
purify your hearts, double-minded. <sup class="v">4:9</sup>Lament,
and mourn, and weep; let your laughter be turned into mourning, and
your joy into sorrow. <sup class="v">4:10</sup>Humble yourselves
before the Lord and he will exalt you.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">4:11</sup>Speak not one against
one another, brothers. He that speaks against a brother or judges
his brother, speaks against the law and judges the law. But if you
judge the law you are not a doer of the law, but a judge.
<sup class="v">4:12</sup>There is one law-giver and judge, who is
able to save and to destroy; but who are you that judge a
neighbor?</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">4:13</sup>Come now, you that say,
To-day and to-morrow we will go to such a city and engage in
business there a year, and trade and make profits, <sup class=
"v">4:14</sup>who know not what will be on the morrow; for what is
your life? You are a mist that appears for a little while and then
vanishes away; <sup class="v">4:15</sup>for you ought to say, If
the Lord wills, we shall both live and do this or that. <sup class=
"v">4:16</sup>But now you glory in your boasting; all such glorying
is evil. <sup class="v">4:17</sup>He therefore that knows how to do
good and does it not, to him it is sin.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">5:1</sup>Come now, rich men, weep
and lament for the miseries which are coming upon you. <sup class=
"v">5:2</sup>Your riches have decayed, and your garments are
moth-eaten, <sup class="v">5:3</sup>your gold and silver are
destroyed with rust, and their rust will be a witness against you,
and consume your flesh like fire. You have laid up treasures for
the last days. <sup class="v">5:4</sup>Behold, the wages of the
laborers who harvested your fields, kept back by you, cry, and the
loud calls of the reapers have entered into the ears of the Lord of
sabaoth. <sup class="v">5:5</sup>You have lived in luxury on the
earth and in pleasure, you have nourished your hearts in a day of
slaughter. <sup class="v">5:6</sup>You have condemned and killed
the just, and he does not resist you.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">5:7</sup>Wait patiently
therefore, brothers, till the coming of the Lord. Behold, the
husbandman waits for the precious fruit of the earth, and is of
long patience, till he receives the autumnal and vernal rain.
<sup class="v">5:8</sup>Do you also have long patience, confirm
your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is at hand. <sup class=
"v">5:9</sup>Complain not, brothers, against one another, that you
be not judged; behold, the judge stands before the doors.
<sup class="v">5:10</sup>You have the prophets who spoke in the
name of the Lord, my brothers, as an example of patience and
long-suffering. <sup class="v">5:11</sup>Behold, we account them
blessed who are patient. You have heard of the patience of Job, and
you know the purpose of the Lord, that he is very merciful and
compassionate.</p>
<p class="pin">8 <sup class="v">5:12</sup>Above all things, my
brothers, swear not, neither by heaven, nor the earth, nor any
other oath. But let your yes be yes, and your no, no, that you may
not fall under condemnation.</p>
<p class="pin">9 <sup class="v">5:13</sup>If any one among you is
afflicted, let him pray; if any one is happy, let him sing psalms;
<sup class="v">5:14</sup>if any one is sick among you, let him send
for the elders of the church, and let them pray for him, anointing
him with oil in the name of the Lord. <sup class="v">5:15</sup>And
the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord will raise
him up; and if he has committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.
<sup class="v">5:16</sup>Confess your faults one to another, and
pray one for another, that you may be cured, for the prayer of the
righteous operates with great power. <sup class=
"v">5:17</sup>Elijah was a man of like passions with us, and he
prayed that it might not rain, and it rained not on the land for
three years and six months; <sup class="v">5:18</sup>and again he
prayed, and heaven gave rain, and the earth yielded her fruit.</p>
<p class="pin">10 <sup class="v">5:19</sup>Brothers, if any one
among you errs from the truth, and one converts him, <sup class=
"v">5:20</sup>let him know that he who converts a sinner from an
error of [his] way, shall save a soul from death, and hide a
multitude of sins.</p>

 PETER.</A></h1>
<h3>BABYLON, A.D. 64.</h3>
<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>
<h3>A FIRM ADHERENCE TO CHRIST, ETC.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">1:1</sup>PETER, an apostle of
Jesus Christ, to the elect strangers of the dispersion of Pontus,
Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia, <sup class=
"v">1:2</sup>according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, by
sanctification of the Spirit, to obedience and the sprinkling of
the blood of Jesus Christ. Grace and peace be multiplied to
you.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">1:3</sup>Blessed be the God and
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who in his great mercy has
begotten us to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus
Christ from the dead, <sup class="v">1:4</sup>to an inheritance
incorruptible and undefiled and unfading, kept in heaven for you
<sup class="v">1:5</sup>who are kept by the power of God through
faith to salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.
<sup class="v">1:6</sup>In which you rejoice, though now for a
little while if need be made sad by manifold trials, <sup class=
"v">1:7</sup>that the trial of your faith, which is much more
precious than gold that is destroyed but proved by fire, may be
found to praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus
Christ, <sup class="v">1:8</sup>whom not having seen you love, in
whom believing though now you see him not you rejoice with joy
unspeakable and glorious, <sup class="v">1:9</sup>receiving the end
of the faith, the salvation of souls. <sup class=
"v">1:10</sup>Concerning which salvation the prophets also who
prophesied concerning the grace [bestowed] on us inquired
diligently and sought, <sup class="v">1:11</sup>inquiring as to
what person or what time the Spirit of Christ which was in them
signified, when it declared before the sufferings of Christ and
after these the glories, <sup class="v">1:12</sup>to whom it was
revealed that they ministered not to themselves but to us those
things which have now been declared to you by those who preached to
you the good news, with the Holy Spirit sent from heaven, into
which the angels desire to look.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">1:13</sup>Wherefore, girding up
the loins of your minds, be sober, and hope to the end for the gift
to be brought to you by the revelation of Jesus Christ. <sup class=
"v">1:14</sup>As obedient children, not conforming yourselves to
the desires of your former ignorance, <sup class="v">1:15</sup>but
as he that called you is holy be you also holy in all [your]
conduct, <sup class="v">1:16</sup>because it is written, Be you
holy, for I am holy. <sup class="v">1:17</sup>And if you call on
the Father, who without respect of persons judges according to each
one's work, spend the time of your life with fear, <sup class=
"v">1:18</sup>knowing that you were not redeemed from your vain
mode of life received by tradition from your fathers, with
destructible things, silver or gold, <sup class="v">1:19</sup>but
with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish,
and without a spot; <sup class="v">1:20</sup>who was foreknown
before the foundation of the world, but made manifest in these last
times for you, <sup class="v">1:21</sup>who through him believed in
God, who raised him from the dead and gave him glory, so that your
faith and hope may be in God.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">1:22</sup>Having purified your
souls by obeying the truth to unfeigned brotherly love, love one
another fervently, from the heart, <sup class="v">1:23</sup>having
been born again, not from destructible seed but from
indestructible, through the word of God which lives and endures.
<sup class="v">1:24</sup>For all flesh is like grass, and all its
glory like the flower of the grass; the grass has withered, and its
flower fell off; <sup class="v">1:25</sup>but the word of the Lord
continues forever. And this is the word preached to you.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">2:1</sup>Laying aside therefore
all malice and all deceit and hypocrisies and envies and all evil
speakings, <sup class="v">2:2</sup>as new born babes desire
earnestly the pure milk of the word, that you may grow by it to
salvation, <sup class="v">2:3</sup>if indeed you have tasted that
the Lord is good. <sup class="v">2:4</sup>To whom coming, a living
stone, rejected indeed by men but approved by God, elect, precious,
<sup class="v">2:5</sup>do you also yourselves be built up living
stones, a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual
sacrifices well pleasing to God through Jesus Christ, <sup class=
"v">2:6</sup>for it is said in the Scripture, Behold, I lay in Zion
a chief corner stone, elect, precious, and he that believes on him
shall not be ashamed. <sup class="v">2:7</sup>To you therefore who
believe he is precious; but to the disobedient, the stone which the
builders rejected has become the head of a corner <sup class=
"v">2:8</sup>and a stone of stumbling and rock of offense, who
stumble at the word, being disobedient, to which also they were
appointed. <sup class="v">2:9</sup>But you are an elect race, a
royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people, that you should
declare the virtues of him who called you out of darkness into his
glorious light; <sup class="v">2:10</sup>who formerly were not a
people, but now are a people of God, who had not obtained mercy,
but now have obtained mercy.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<h3>PERSONAL, POLITICAL, AND SOCIAL DUTIES, ETC.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">2:11</sup>BELOVED, I exhort you
as strangers and foreigners, abstain from carnal desires, which war
against the soul, <sup class="v">2:12</sup>having your conduct
honorable among the gentiles, that wherein they speak against you
as evil-doers, from the good works which they see they may glorify
God in the day of visitation.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">2:13</sup>Be subject therefore to
every human government, for the Lord's sake, whether to the king,
as superior, <sup class="v">2:14</sup>to governors, sent by him for
the punishment of evil doers and the praise of those who do well;
<sup class="v">2:15</sup>for this is the will of God, that by
well-doing you may silence the ignorance of foolish men;
<sup class="v">2:16</sup>as free, and not using freedom for a cloak
of vice, but as servants of God. <sup class="v">2:17</sup>Honor all
men, love the brotherhood, fear God, honor the king.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">2:18</sup>Let servants be subject
with all fear to masters, not only to the good and gentle but also
to the perverse. <sup class="v">2:19</sup>For this deserves thanks,
if on account of a knowledge of God one endures pain, suffering
unjustly. <sup class="v">2:20</sup>For what glory is it if when you
sin and are punished you bear it patiently? But if you do well and
suffer and bear it patiently, [this deserves thanks], for it is
acceptable to God. <sup class="v">2:21</sup>For to this you were
called, because Christ also suffered for us, leaving you a copy
that you should follow his steps, <sup class="v">2:22</sup>who
committed no sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth,
<sup class="v">2:23</sup>who being reviled reviled not, suffering
threatened not, but committed himself to him that judges
righteously, <sup class="v">2:24</sup>who himself bore our sins in
his body on the cross, that we having died to sins, may live to
righteousness; by whose stripes you were healed. <sup class=
"v">2:25</sup>For you were like lost sheep, but are now returned to
the shepherd and bishop of your souls.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">3:1</sup>In like manner let the
women be subject to their husbands, that even if some disobey the
word, they may be gained through the conduct of their wives without
the word, <sup class="v">3:2</sup>seeing your pure mode of life in
the fear [of God]. <sup class="v">3:3</sup>Whose ornament let it
not be the external [ornament] of braided hair and the putting on
of chains of gold or of clothing, <sup class="v">3:4</sup>but let
the hidden man of the heart be adorned with the imperishable
[ornaments] of a meek and quiet spirit, which are of great price
before God. <sup class="v">3:5</sup>For so formerly also the holy
women who hoped in God adorned themselves, being subject to their
husbands, <sup class="v">3:6</sup>as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling
him Lord, whose children you are, doing good and having no fear.
<sup class="v">3:7</sup>In like manner let the husbands [do],
living together in knowledge with the wife as with a vessel of less
strength, deeming them precious, co-heirs of the grace of life,
that your prayers may not be hindered.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">3:8</sup>Finally, be all of one
mind, sympathising, loving as brothers, compassionate, humble,
<sup class="v">3:9</sup>not returning evil for evil or railing for
railing, but on the contrary blessing [your enemies], because to
this you are called, that you may inherit blessing. <sup class=
"v">3:10</sup>For he that will love life and see good days, let him
withhold his tongue from evil and his lips from speaking deceit,
<sup class="v">3:11</sup>let him abstain from evil and do good, let
him seek peace and pursue it, <sup class="v">3:12</sup>for the eyes
of the Lord are on the righteous and his ears attend to their
prayer, but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">3:13</sup>And who is he that will
injure you if you are followers of what is good? <sup class=
"v">3:14</sup>But even if you suffer on account of righteousness,
you are blessed. But fear not with their fear, neither be troubled;
<sup class="v">3:15</sup>and sanctify the anointed Lord in your
hearts, and be always ready with a defense to every one that asks
you a reason for the hope that is in you; but with meekness and
fear, <sup class="v">3:16</sup>having a good conscience, that in
what they speak evil of you they may be ashamed who slander your
good conduct in Christ. <sup class="v">3:17</sup>For it is better
to suffer doing good, if the will of God allows, than doing evil.
<sup class="v">3:18</sup>For Christ also suffered once for sins,
the just for the unjust, that he might lead us to God, being put to
death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit, <sup class=
"v">3:19</sup>in which also he went and preached to the spirits in
prison, <sup class="v">3:20</sup>who were formerly disobedient when
the long suffering of God waited in the days of Noah while the ark
was being prepared, in which a few, that is eight souls, were saved
by water. <sup class="v">3:21</sup>The archetype of which, baptism,
also now saves us, not the putting away of the filth of the flesh,
but the answer of a good conscience in God, through the
resurrection of Jesus Christ, <sup class="v">3:22</sup>who is on
the right hand of God, having gone to heaven, angels and
authorities and powers being made subject to him.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">4:1</sup>Christ therefore having
suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves also with the same
mind, for he that has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin,
<sup class="v">4:2</sup>that you may no longer live the rest of
your time in the flesh according to the desires of men, but
according to the will of God. <sup class="v">4:3</sup>For the time
past is sufficient for us to have performed the will of the
gentiles, walking in lewdness, inordinate desires, drunkenness,
revellings, drinkings and unlawful idolatries, <sup class=
"v">4:4</sup>in which they think it strange that you run not with
them to the same excessive intemperance, blaspheming, <sup class=
"v">4:5</sup>who shall give an account to him that is ready to
judge the living and dead. <sup class="v">4:6</sup>And for this
cause was the gospel preached also to the dead, that they might be
judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in
the Spirit.</p>
<p class="pin">8 <sup class="v">4:7</sup>But the end of all
things is at hand. Be sober therefore, and watch in prayers;
<sup class="v">4:8</sup>above all things have fervent love one for
another, for love hides a multitude of sins. <sup class=
"v">4:9</sup>Be hospitable one to another, without complaining;
<sup class="v">4:10</sup>as each has received a gift, minister the
same among yourselves as good stewards of the manifold grace of
God. <sup class="v">4:11</sup>If any one speaks, let him speak as
the oracles of God, if any one serves, let it be as of the strength
which God supplies, that in all things God may be glorified through
Jesus Christ, whose is the glory and the power for ever and ever;
amen.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<h3>TRIALS, ADMONITIONS TO PRESBYTERS, ETC.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">4:12</sup>BELOVED, think not
strange of the fiery trial which is to try you, as if some strange
thing happened to you, <sup class="v">4:13</sup>but as you partake
of the sufferings of Christ rejoice, that you may also rejoice
exulting at the revelation of his glory. <sup class=
"v">4:14</sup>If you are reproached for the name of Christ, happy
are you, for the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you.
<sup class="v">4:15</sup>But let none of you suffer as a murderer,
or a thief, or an evil doer, or as a meddler in other men's
affairs; <sup class="v">4:16</sup>but as a Christian, let him not
be ashamed, let him glorify God on this account. <sup class=
"v">4:17</sup>For it is time for judgment to begin at the house of
God; and if it first begins with us, what will the end be of those
that obey not the gospel of God? <sup class="v">4:18</sup>And if
the righteous man is scarcely saved, where will the ungodly and the
sinner appear? <sup class="v">4:19</sup>Let those therefore who
suffer by the will of God, commit their souls to him in well doing
as a faithful creator.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">5:1</sup>The elders among you I
exhort, who am a co-elder and witness of the sufferings of Christ,
and a partaker of the glory to be revealed; <sup class=
"v">5:2</sup>feed the flock of God which is among you, not by
constraint but willingly, not for base gain but of a ready mind,
<sup class="v">5:3</sup>not as having a lordship over God's
inheritance but being examples to the flock; <sup class=
"v">5:4</sup>and when the chief shepherd shall appear, you shall
receive an unfading crown of glory.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">5:5</sup>Let the younger in like
manner be subject to the elder, and do you all be subject one to
another, and be clothed with humility; for God resists the proud
but gives grace to the humble. <sup class="v">5:6</sup>Humble
yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may
exalt you in due time; <sup class="v">5:7</sup>casting all your
care upon him, for he cares for you.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">5:8</sup>Be sober, be watchful.
Your adversary the devil goes about like a roaring lion, seeking
whom he may devour; <sup class="v">5:9</sup>whom resist, firm in
the faith, knowing that the same sufferings are accomplished by
your brothers in the world. <sup class="v">5:10</sup>And may the
God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory in Christ
Jesus, when you have suffered a little while, himself make you
perfect, confirm, strengthen, establish you. <sup class=
"v">5:11</sup>To him be the glory and the power for ever; amen.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">5:12</sup>I have written to you
in a few words by Silvanus [Silas], a faithful brother as I
suppose, exhorting you, and testifying that this is the true grace
of God in which you stand. <sup class="v">5:13</sup>The co-elect
[church] at Babylon salutes you, and Mark my son. <sup class=
"v">5:14</sup>Salute one another with a kiss of love. Peace be to
you all in Christ.</p>

<h3>THE PURSUIT OF THE VIRTUES, THE GLORY OF CHRIST, FALSE
TEACHERS, ETC.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">1:1</sup>SIMEON Peter, a servant
and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who have obtained a like
precious faith with us by the righteousness of our God and Saviour
Jesus Christ. <sup class="v">1:2</sup>Grace and peace be multiplied
to you by a knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">1:3</sup>As his divine power has
given us all things which pertain to life and piety, through the
knowledge of him that has called us to his own glory and virtue,
<sup class="v">1:4</sup>through which have been given us very great
and precious promises, that by these you might be partakers of the
divine nature, having escaped from the corruption which is in the
world by inordinate desire, <sup class="v">1:5</sup>and for the
same purpose also, giving all diligence add to your faith virtue,
and to virtue knowledge, <sup class="v">1:6</sup>and to knowledge
temperance, and to temperance patience, and to patience piety,
<sup class="v">1:7</sup>and to piety brotherly kindness, and to
brotherly kindness love. <sup class="v">1:8</sup>For if these are
in you and abound, they will make you not inactive nor unfruitful
in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ; <sup class=
"v">1:9</sup>for a man that is without these is blind, not seeing
to a distance, and has forgotten the purification from his former
errors. <sup class="v">1:10</sup>Wherefore, brothers, use the
greater diligence to make your calling and election sure; for doing
these things you shall never fall. <sup class="v">1:11</sup>For
thus shall you have an abundant entrance given you into the eternal
kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">1:12</sup>Wherefore I will not
neglect always to remind you of these things, although you have
known them, and have been established in the present truth.
<sup class="v">1:13</sup>I think it right as long as I am in this
tabernacle, to excite you by remembrance, <sup class=
"v">1:14</sup>knowing that the putting off of my tabernacle is at
hand, as our Lord Jesus Christ showed me. <sup class=
"v">1:15</sup>But I will also be diligent and especially that you
may be able to make mention of these things after my departure.
<sup class="v">1:16</sup>For we did not follow skilfully
constructed myths in making known to you the power and appearing of
our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eye witnesses of his majesty.
<sup class="v">1:17</sup>For he received from God the Father honor
and glory, when this voice was brought to him from the magnificent
glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
<sup class="v">1:18</sup>And this voice we heard brought from
heaven when we were with him on the holy mount. <sup class=
"v">1:19</sup>And we have the more sure prophetic word, to which
you will do well to attend, as to a light shining in a dark place,
till the day dawns and the day-star arises in your hearts,
<sup class="v">1:20</sup>knowing this first, that no prophecy of
Scripture is of its own solution. <sup class="v">1:21</sup>For
prophecy was never brought by the will of man, but moved by the
Holy Spirit men spoke from God.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">2:1</sup>But there were also
false prophets among the people, as there shall also be false
teachers among you, who shall bring in by stealth destructive
heresies, even denying the master that bought them, bringing on
themselves swift destruction; <sup class="v">2:2</sup>and many
shall follow their lewdness, on account of whom the way of truth
shall be reviled, <sup class="v">2:3</sup>and with covetousness
they will make a gain of you with feigned words, whose judgment a
long time lingers not, and their destruction slumbers not.
<sup class="v">2:4</sup>For if God spared not the angels that
sinned, but plunging them into Tartarus delivered them up in chains
to be kept in darkness till the judgment, <sup class=
"v">2:5</sup>and spared not the old world, but preserved Noah a
preacher of righteousness, with seven others, bringing the flood on
the world of the ungodly, <sup class="v">2:6</sup>and condemned
Sodom and Gomorrah to be overthrown, reducing them to ashes, making
them an example to those who should afterwards be wicked,
<sup class="v">2:7</sup>and delivered righteous Lot, vexed by the
lewd conduct of the wicked;&mdash; <sup class="v">2:8</sup>for that
righteous man living among them vexed his righteous soul from day
to day by seeing and hearing their wicked deeds;&mdash; <sup class=
"v">2:9</sup>the Lord knows how to deliver the pious from trial,
and to keep the wicked to the day of judgment to be punished,
<sup class="v">2:10</sup>but especially those who walk after the
flesh, in corrupt desires, and despise government. Presumptuous,
self-complacent, they fear not to revile glories, <sup class=
"v">2:11</sup>where the angels who are greater in strength and
power do not bring against them a reproachful judgment; <sup class=
"v">2:12</sup>but these, like irrational animals, brutes made to be
taken and destroyed, reviling things which they do not understand,
will also be destroyed in their depravity, <sup class=
"v">2:13</sup>receiving the wages of wickedness, accounting luxury
in the day-time a pleasure, spots and blemishes, revelling in their
deceptions while feasting with you, <sup class="v">2:14</sup>having
eyes full of an adulteress, and unable to cease from sin, enticing
unstable souls, having a heart exercised in covetousness, cursed
children, <sup class="v">2:15</sup>having left the right way they
have gone astray, following in the way of Balaam the son of Beor
who loved the wages of wickedness, <sup class="v">2:16</sup>but had
a rebuke of his transgression; the dumb ass, speaking with a man's
voice, forbade the madness of the prophet.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">2:17</sup>These are fountains
without water, clouds driven by a tempest, to which is reserved the
blackness of darkness. <sup class="v">2:18</sup>For speaking
extravagant words of vanity, they entice with carnal desires of
lewdness those scarcely escaped from them, those living in error,
<sup class="v">2:19</sup>promising them liberty, when they
themselves are servants of corruption; for by whatever a man is
overcome, to this is he made a servant. <sup class=
"v">2:20</sup>For if having escaped the defilements of the world by
a knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again
entangled and overcome by them, the last state of those persons is
worse than the first. <sup class="v">2:21</sup>For it is better for
them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, having
known, to turn from the holy commandment delivered to them.
<sup class="v">2:22</sup>But it has happened to them according to
the true proverb, The dog returned to his vomit, and the swine that
was washed to wallowing in filth.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<h3>THE COMING OF CHRIST, ETC.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">3:1</sup>THIS second epistle,
beloved, I now write to you, in which I excite your pure minds by
remembrance, <sup class="v">3:2</sup>to remember the words spoken
before by the holy prophets, and the commandment of us the apostles
of the Lord and Saviour, <sup class="v">3:3</sup>knowing this
first, that in the last days scoffers shall come with scoffing
walking after their inordinate desires, <sup class="v">3:4</sup>and
saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers
fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of
the world. <sup class="v">3:5</sup>For of this they are willingly
ignorant, that the heavens were of old, and the earth was made of
water and by water by the word of God, <sup class="v">3:6</sup>by
which the world that then was, being overflowed with water, was
destroyed. <sup class="v">3:7</sup>But the present heavens and the
earth have been preserved by his word, being kept for fire, at the
day of the judgment and destruction of wicked men.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">3:8</sup>But let not this one
thing escape you, beloved, that one day with the Lord is as a
thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. <sup class=
"v">3:9</sup>The Lord is not slow in respect to his promise, as
some men account slowness, but is long-suffering toward us, not
willing that any should perish, but that all should come to a
change of mind.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">3:10</sup>But the day of the Lord
will come as a thief, in which the heavens shall pass away with a
crash, and the elements be melted with heat, and the earth and the
works in it be consumed. <sup class="v">3:11</sup>All these things
therefore being dissolved, what persons ought we to be in holy
conduct and piety, <sup class="v">3:12</sup>expecting and hastening
the coming of the day of God, in which the heavens being burnt up
will be dissolved and the elements be melted with heat. <sup class=
"v">3:13</sup>But we, according to his promise, look for a new
heaven and a new earth, in which dwells righteousness.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">3:14</sup>Wherefore, beloved,
looking for these things, be diligent that you may be found in him
without a spot and blemish, in peace, <sup class="v">3:15</sup>and
consider the long-suffering of the Lord our salvation; as also our
beloved brother Paul according to the wisdom given to him wrote to
you, <sup class="v">3:16</sup>as also in all his epistles speaking
of these things, in which are some things hard to be understood,
which the unlearned and unstable wrest as they also do the other
Scriptures to their destruction. <sup class="v">3:17</sup>Do you
therefore, beloved, knowing [these things] before, be on your guard
not to be carried away with the error of the wicked and fall from
your steadfastness, <sup class="v">3:18</sup>but grow in grace and
in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be
the glory both now and forever.</p>

Father, and the called who are kept by Jesus Christ. <sup class=
"v">1:2</sup>Mercy and peace and love be multiplied to you.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">1:3</sup>Beloved, giving all
diligence to write to you concerning the common salvation, I was
under a necessity to write and exhort you to contend earnestly for
the faith once delivered to the saints. <sup class="v">1:4</sup>For
some men have come in by deception, who were of old appointed to
this judgment, impious, changing the grace of our God into
lewdness, and denying our only master and Lord, Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">1:5</sup>But I wish to remind
you, though you once knew all, that the Lord having saved his
people from Egypt, afterwards destroyed those that believed not,
<sup class="v">1:6</sup>and the angels who kept not their own
province, but left their habitation, he has kept under darkness in
eternal chains, for the judgment of the great day; <sup class=
"v">1:7</sup>as Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities about them,
committing fornication in the same manner as these and going after
unnatural lewdness, are made an example, enduring the punishment of
eternal fire.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">1:8</sup>In like manner also
these dreamers defile the flesh, reject government, and blaspheme
glories. <sup class="v">1:9</sup>But Michael the arch-angel, when
disputing with the devil he reasoned about the body of Moses, dared
not bring against him a charge of blasphemy, but said, The Lord
rebuke you. <sup class="v">1:10</sup>But these blaspheme what they
do not understand, and what they know naturally, as brute beasts,
in these things they corrupt themselves. <sup class=
"v">1:11</sup>Woe to them; for they have gone in the way of Cain,
and rushed into the error of Balaam for a reward, and perished in
the contradiction of Korah. <sup class="v">1:12</sup>These are
breakers at your love-feasts, feasting with you without fear,
feeding themselves, clouds without water driven about by winds,
autumnal trees without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots,
<sup class="v">1:13</sup>wild waves of the sea foaming with their
own shame, wandering stars to which is reserved the blackness of
darkness for ever.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">1:14</sup>And Enoch also, the
seventh from Adam, prophesied of them, saying, Behold, the Lord
came with ten thousand of his saints <sup class="v">1:15</sup>to
execute judgment on all, and to convict all the wicked among them
of all the deeds of impiety which they have impiously committed,
and of all the hard speeches which impious sinners have spoken
against him. <sup class="v">1:16</sup>These are complainers,
censorious, walking after their inordinate desires, and their mouth
speaks proud words, showing admiration of persons for the sake of
gain.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">1:17</sup>But do you, beloved,
remember the words spoken before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus
Christ, <sup class="v">1:18</sup>that they said to you, That in the
last time there shall be scoffers, walking in their own impious
desires. <sup class="v">1:19</sup>These are they who separate
themselves, sensual, having not the Spirit. <sup class=
"v">1:20</sup>But you, beloved, build yourselves up in your most
holy faith, pray with the Holy Spirit. <sup class=
"v">1:21</sup>Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the
mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to eternal life. <sup class=
"v">1:22</sup>And reprove some, separatists, <sup class=
"v">1:23</sup>and some save, plucking them from the fire, but have
mercy on others with fear, hating even the garment that is defiled
by the flesh.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">1:24</sup>And to him that is able
to keep you without falling, and to present you blameless before
his glory, with great joy, <sup class="v">1:25</sup>to God our only
Saviour, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, power
and authority before all worlds, both now and for ever more;

our eyes, that which we beheld and our hands felt, concerning the
Word of life,&mdash; <sup class="v">1:2</sup>and the life was made
manifest, and we have seen, and testify, and declare to you the
eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested to
us,&mdash; <sup class="v">1:3</sup>that which we have seen and
heard, we declare to you, that you also may have fellowship with
us. And our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son Jesus
Christ. <sup class="v">1:4</sup>And these things we write to you,
that your joy may be complete.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">1:5</sup>And this is the message
which we have heard from him and declare to you, That God is light,
and with him there is no darkness. <sup class="v">1:6</sup>If we
say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie
and observe not the truth; <sup class="v">1:7</sup>but if we walk
in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with
another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin.
<sup class="v">1:8</sup>If we say we have not sin, we deceive
ourselves, and the truth is not in us. <sup class="v">1:9</sup>If
we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive our sins,
and to cleanse us from all wickedness. <sup class="v">1:10</sup>If
we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is
not in us.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">2:1</sup>My little children,
these things I write to you that you may not sin. But if any one
has sinned, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the
righteous, <sup class="v">2:2</sup>and he is a propitiation for our
sins, and not for ours only but for all the world. <sup class=
"v">2:3</sup>And by this we know that we have known him, if we keep
his commandments. <sup class="v">2:4</sup>He that says, I have
known him, and keeps not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth
is not in him; <sup class="v">2:5</sup>but whoever keeps his word,
in him truly is the love of God perfected. By this we know that we
are in him. <sup class="v">2:6</sup>He that says he continues in
him, ought also himself so to walk as he walked.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">2:7</sup>Beloved, I write not a
new commandment to you, but an old commandment, which you had from
the beginning; the old commandment is the word which you heard.
<sup class="v">2:8</sup>Again, a new commandment I write you, which
is true in him and in you, because the darkness is past and the
true light now appears. <sup class="v">2:9</sup>He that says he is
in the light, and hates his brother, is in darkness till now.
<sup class="v">2:10</sup>He that loves his brother continues in the
light, and there is no offense in him; <sup class="v">2:11</sup>but
he that hates his brother is in darkness, and walks in darkness,
and knows not where he goes, because the darkness has blinded his
eyes.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">2:12</sup>I write to you, little
children, because your sins are forgiven on account of his name.
<sup class="v">2:13</sup>I write to you, fathers, because you have
known him that is from the beginning. I write to you, young men,
because you have overcome the evil one. I wrote to you, little
children, because you have known the Father. <sup class=
"v">2:14</sup>I wrote to you, fathers, because you have known him
that is from the beginning. I wrote to you, young men, because you
are strong, and the word of God continues in you, and you have
overcome the evil one. <sup class="v">2:15</sup>Love not the world,
nor the things in the world. If any one loves the world, the love
of the Father is not in him; <sup class="v">2:16</sup>for all that
is in the world, the desire of the flesh and the desire of the eyes
and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.
<sup class="v">2:17</sup>And the world passes away, and its
desires; but he that does the will of God continues for ever.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">2:18</sup>Little children, it is
the last time; and as you heard that antichrist is coming, even now
many have become anti-christs; whence we know that it is the last
time. <sup class="v">2:19</sup>They went out from us, but they were
not of us; for if they had been of us they would have continued
with us; but [they went out from us] that they might be manifest
that they are not all of us. <sup class="v">2:20</sup>And you have
an anointing from the Holy One, and know all things. <sup class=
"v">2:21</sup>I have not written to you because you know not the
truth, but because you know it, and because no lie is of the truth.
<sup class="v">2:22</sup>Who is a liar but he that denies that
Jesus is the Christ? This is the anti-christ, [the man that] denies
the Father and the Son. <sup class="v">2:23</sup>No one that denies
the Son has the Father; he that confesses the Son has the Father
also. <sup class="v">2:24</sup>Let that which you heard from the
beginning continue in you. If that which you heard from the
beginning continues in you, you also shall continue in the Son and
in the Father. <sup class="v">2:25</sup>And this is the promise
which he promised us, the eternal life.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">2:26</sup>I have written these
things to you concerning those who deceive you. <sup class=
"v">2:27</sup>And the anointing which you received from him
continues in you, and you have no need that any one should teach
you; but as his anointing teaches you of all things, and is true
and is not a lie, even as it has taught you, continue in him.</p>
<p class="pin">8 <sup class="v">2:28</sup>And now, little
children, continue in him, that when he shall appear we may have
boldness, and not be put to shame by him at his coming. <sup class=
"v">2:29</sup>If you know that he is righteous, you know that every
one who does righteousness has been born of him.</p>
<p class="pin">9 <sup class="v">3:1</sup>See what love the Father
has given us, that we should be called children of God. The world
therefore knows us not, because it knew him not.</p>
<p class="pin">10 <sup class="v">3:2</sup>Beloved, now are we
children of God, and it does not yet appear what we shall be. We
know, that if he shall appear, we shall be like him, for we shall
see him as he is. <sup class="v">3:3</sup>And every one that has
this hope in him purifies himself, as he is pure. <sup class=
"v">3:4</sup>Every one that commits sin commits also wickedness,
and sin is wickedness. <sup class="v">3:5</sup>And we know that he
was manifested to take away sins, and in him there is no sin.
<sup class="v">3:6</sup>No one that continues in him sins; no one
that sins has seen him, or known him.</p>
<p class="pin">11 <sup class="v">3:7</sup>Little children, let no
one deceive you. He that does righteousness is righteous, as he is
righteous; <sup class="v">3:8</sup>he that commits sin is of the
devil, for the devil sinned from the beginning. For this was the
Son of God manifested, to destroy the works of the devil.
<sup class="v">3:9</sup>No one that has been born of God commits
sin, for his seed continues in him, and he cannot sin, because he
has been born of God. <sup class="v">3:10</sup>By this are the
children of God manifest, and the children of the devil; no one
that does not righteousness is of God, and no one that loves not
his brother. <sup class="v">3:11</sup>For this is the message which
you heard from the beginning; that we should love one another;
<sup class="v">3:12</sup>not as Cain was of the evil one and killed
his brother; and why did he kill him? because his works were evil,
and his brother's righteous.</p>
<p class="pin">12 <sup class="v">3:13</sup>Wonder not, brothers,
if the world hates you. <sup class="v">3:14</sup>We know that we
have passed from death to life, because we love the brothers; he
that loves not, continues in death. <sup class="v">3:15</sup>Every
one that hates his brother is a murderer; and we know that no
murderer has eternal life continuing in him. <sup class=
"v">3:16</sup>By this we have known love, because he laid down his
life for us; and we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers.
<sup class="v">3:17</sup>And whoever has the goods of the world and
sees his brother have need, and withholds his compassions from him,
how continues the love of God in him?</p>
<p class="pin">13 <sup class="v">3:18</sup>My little children,
let us not love in word nor tongue, but in work and truth.
<sup class="v">3:19</sup>And by this we know that we are of the
truth, and shall assure our hearts before him; <sup class=
"v">3:20</sup>for if our minds condemn us, God is greater than our
minds and knows all things.</p>
<p class="pin">14 <sup class="v">3:21</sup>Beloved, if our minds
do not condemn us, we have boldness before God, <sup class=
"v">3:22</sup>and what we ask we receive from him, because we keep
his commandments and do the things which are pleasing in his sight.
<sup class="v">3:23</sup>And this is his commandment; that we
should believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one
another as he gave commandment. <sup class="v">3:24</sup>And he
that keeps his commandments continues in him and he in him; and by
this we know that he continues in us, by the Spirit which he gave
us.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<h3>FALSE SPIRITS, BROTHERLY LOVE, THE LOVE OF GOD, THE THREE
WITNESSES, ETC.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">4:1</sup>BELOVED, believe not
every spirit, but prove the spirits whether they are of God; for
many false prophets have gone out into the world. <sup class=
"v">4:2</sup>By this you know the Spirit of God; every spirit which
confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God,
<sup class="v">4:3</sup>and every spirit which does not confess
Jesus is not of God. And this is the [spirit] of anti-christ, of
which you have heard that he is coming, and he is now in the world
already.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">4:4</sup>You are of God, little
children, and have overcome them, because greater is he that is in
you than he that is in the world. <sup class="v">4:5</sup>They are
of the world; therefore they speak of the world and the world hears
them. <sup class="v">4:6</sup>We are of God; he that knows God
hears us, he that is not of God does not hear us. By this we know
the spirit of truth and the spirit of error.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">4:7</sup>Beloved, let us love one
another, for love is of God, and every one that loves has been born
of God and knows God. <sup class="v">4:8</sup>He that loves not has
not known God; for God is love. <sup class="v">4:9</sup>The love of
God was manifested to us in this; that God has sent his only Son
into the world that we may live through him. <sup class=
"v">4:10</sup>In this is love; not that we loved God, but that he
loved us, and sent his Son a propitiation for our sins.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">4:11</sup>Beloved, if God so
loved us, we ought also to love one another. <sup class=
"v">4:12</sup>No one has ever seen God. If we love one another, God
continues in us and his love is perfected in us. <sup class=
"v">4:13</sup>By this we know that we continue in him and he in us,
that he has given us of his Spirit. <sup class="v">4:14</sup>And we
have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son, the Saviour
of the world. <sup class="v">4:15</sup>Whoever confesses that Jesus
is the Son of God, God continues in him and he in God. <sup class=
"v">4:16</sup>And we have known and believed the love which God has
for us. God is love; and he that continues in love continues in God
and God in him.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">4:17</sup>By this is love
perfected with us, that we may have boldness in the day of
judgment, that as he is we also are in this world. <sup class=
"v">4:18</sup>There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out
fear; for fear has pain; and he that is afraid is not made perfect
in love. <sup class="v">4:19</sup>We love, because he first loved
us. <sup class="v">4:20</sup>If any one says, I love God, and hates
his brother, he is a liar; for he that loves not his brother whom
he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen? <sup class=
"v">4:21</sup>And we have this commandment from him, that he who
loves God should also love his brother.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">5:1</sup>Every one who believes
that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God, and every one who
loves the Father loves also the Son who is born to him. <sup class=
"v">5:2</sup>By this we know that we love the children of God, when
we love God and keep his commandments. <sup class="v">5:3</sup>For
this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments; and his
commandments are not grievous; <sup class="v">5:4</sup>for every
child that has been born of God overcomes the world; and this is
the victory which overcomes the world, our faith. <sup class=
"v">5:5</sup>Who is he that overcomes the world, but he that
believes that Jesus is the Son of God?</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">5:6</sup>This is he that came by
water and blood, Jesus, the Christ; not by water only, but by water
and by blood; and the Spirit is that which testifies, for the
Spirit is the truth. <sup class="v">5:7</sup>For there are three
that testify; the Spirit, and the water, and the blood; and the
three are one. <sup class="v">5:9</sup>If we receive the testimony
of men, the testimony of God is greater; for this is the testimony
of God that he has testified concerning his Son. <sup class=
"v">5:10</sup>He that believes on the Son of God has the testimony
in himself; he that believes not God has made him a liar, because
he has not believed in the testimony which God has testified
concerning his Son. <sup class="v">5:11</sup>And this is the
testimony, that God gave us eternal life, and this life is in his
Son. <sup class="v">5:12</sup>He that has the Son has the life; he
that has not the Son has not the life.</p>
<p class="pin">8 <sup class="v">5:13</sup>These things have I
written to you, that you who believe in the name of the Son of God
may know that you have eternal life. <sup class="v">5:14</sup>And
this is the confidence which we have in respect to him, that if we
ask any thing according to his will he hears us. <sup class=
"v">5:15</sup>And if we know that he hears us whatever we ask, we
know that we have the petitions which we have asked of him.
<sup class="v">5:16</sup>If any one sees his brother commit a sin,
not to death, he shall ask, and he will give him life, for those
who sin not to death. There is a sin to death; I say not that you
should pray for it. <sup class="v">5:17</sup>All wickedness is sin,
and there is sin not to death.</p>
<p class="pin">9 <sup class="v">5:18</sup>We know that every one
who has been born of God does not sin, but he that has been born of
God keeps himself, and the evil one does not touch him. <sup class=
"v">5:19</sup>We know that we are of God, and the whole world lies
in wickedness. <sup class="v">5:20</sup>And we know that the Son of
God has come, and has given us understanding that we may know the
true One; and we are in the true One, in his Son Jesus Christ; this
is the true God, and eternal life. <sup class="v">5:21</sup>Little
children, keep yourselves from idols.</p>

beseech you, Curia, not as if writing a new commandment to you, but
[one] which we had from the beginning, that we should love one
another. <sup class="v">1:6</sup>And this is love, that we should
walk according to his commandments; this is the commandment, as you
heard from the beginning, that you should walk in it. <sup class=
"v">1:7</sup>For many deceivers have gone out into the world, who
do not confess Jesus Christ coming in the flesh; this is the
deceiver, and the antichrist. <sup class="v">1:8</sup>Take heed to
yourselves, that ye lose not the labor which you performed, but
receive a full reward. <sup class="v">1:9</sup>Every one who goes
beyond, and continues not in the doctrine of Christ, is without
God. He that continues in the doctrine has both the Son and the
Father. <sup class="v">1:10</sup>If any one comes to you and brings
not this doctrine, receive him not into your houses, and salute him
not; <sup class="v">1:11</sup>for he that salutes him is a partaker

than this, that I hear of my children walking in the truth.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">1:5</sup>Beloved, you did
faithfully whatever you do to the brothers, and that to strangers,
<sup class="v">1:6</sup>who testified of your love before the
church, whom you will do well to send forward worthily of God.
<sup class="v">1:7</sup>For they went out for his name, taking
nothing of the gentiles. <sup class="v">1:8</sup>We therefore ought
to receive such, that we may be co-laborers for the truth.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">1:9</sup>I wrote something to the

us. <sup class="v">1:10</sup>Therefore if I come I will remember
his works which he performs, prating against us with evil words,

wishing to do it.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">1:11</sup>Beloved, do not imitate

<h3>A.D. 68.</h3>
<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST THE SON OF GOD SUPERIOR TO ANGELS AND TO MOSES.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">1:1</sup>GOD, who at many times
and in many ways spoke anciently to the fathers by the prophets,
<sup class="v">1:2</sup>in these last days spoke to us by his Son,
whom he appointed heir of all things, through whom also he made the
worlds, <sup class="v">1:3</sup>who being the brightness of his
glory and the express image of his substance, and sustaining all
things by the word of his power, having made a purification of
sins, sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high,
<sup class="v">1:4</sup>being made as much greater than the angels
as he has inherited a more excellent name than they. <sup class=
"v">1:5</sup>For to which of the angels said he at any time, You
are my Son, to-day have I begotten you? And again, I will be to him
a Father and he shall be to me a Son? <sup class="v">1:6</sup>And
again, when be brings the first-born into the world he says, And
let all the angels of God worship him. <sup class="v">1:7</sup>And
of the angels he says, Who makes his angels winds, and his
ministers a flame of fire; <sup class="v">1:8</sup>but of the Son,
Thy throne, God, is forever and ever; the sceptre of thy kingdom is
a sceptre of rectitude. <sup class="v">1:9</sup>Thou hast loved
righteousness and hated wickedness; therefore God, thy God,
anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy companions.
<sup class="v">1:10</sup>And thou, Lord, in the beginning didst
build from its foundations the earth, and the heavens are works of
thy hands; <sup class="v">1:11</sup>they shall perish, but thou
shalt continue; and they shall all become old like a garment,
<sup class="v">1:12</sup>and like a mantle thou shalt fold them up,
and they shall be changed, but thou art the same and thy years
shall not fail. <sup class="v">1:13</sup>And to which of the angels
said he at any time, Sit on my right hand till I make thy enemies
thy footstool? <sup class="v">1:14</sup>Are they not all
ministering spirits, sent forth to serve on account of those who
are about to inherit salvation?</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">2:1</sup>We ought therefore to
attend the more to the things which we heard, lest at any time we
should glide away [from them]. <sup class="v">2:2</sup>For if the
word spoken by angels was firm, and every transgression and
disobedience received a just recompense, <sup class=
"v">2:3</sup>how shall we escape who have neglected so great a
salvation? which began to be spoken by the Lord, and was affirmed
to us by those who heard, <sup class="v">2:4</sup>God bearing them
witness with signs and prodigies, and various mighty works and
gifts of the holy Spirit, according to his will.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">2:5</sup>For he did not subject
to angels the world to come, of which we speak. <sup class=
"v">2:6</sup>But one somewhere testified, saying, What is man that
thou art mindful of him, or a son of man that thou visitest him?
<sup class="v">2:7</sup>Thou didst make him a little lower than
angels, thou didst crown him with glory and honor, <sup class=
"v">2:8</sup>thou didst subject all things under his feet. For in
subjecting all things to him, he left nothing not subjected to him.
But now we do not yet see all things subjected to him. <sup class=
"v">2:9</sup>But we see Jesus, made a little less than angels, on
account of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor,
that by the grace of God he should taste death for every [man].
<sup class="v">2:10</sup>For it became him, for whom are all things
and through whom are all things, to perfect by sufferings the
prince of their salvation, bringing many sons to glory. <sup class=
"v">2:11</sup>For both he that sanctifies and the sanctified are
all of one; for which cause he is not ashamed to call them
brothers, <sup class="v">2:12</sup>saying, I will declare thy name
to my brothers, in the midst of the assembly will I sing to thee.
<sup class="v">2:13</sup>And again, I will trust in him. And again,
Behold me and the children which God gave me. <sup class=
"v">2:14</sup>Since then the children have partaken of blood and
flesh, he in like manner also partook of them, that through death
he might destroy him that has the power of death, that is the
devil, <sup class="v">2:15</sup>and liberate those who all their
life were subjects of servitude to the fear of death. <sup class=
"v">2:16</sup>For indeed he helped not angels, but he helped the
descendants of Abraham. <sup class="v">2:17</sup>Whence he ought in
all things to be assimilated to the brothers, that he may be a
merciful and faithful chief priest as to things relating to God, to
make propitiation for the sins of the people. <sup class=
"v">2:18</sup>For because he has himself suffered, having been
tried, he is able to help the tried.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">3:1</sup>Whence, holy brothers,
partakers of the heavenly call, consider the apostle and chief
priest of our profession, Jesus, <sup class="v">3:2</sup>who is
faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was in his house.
<sup class="v">3:3</sup>For this man is judged worthy of more glory
than Moses, as much as he has more honor than the house
[tabernacle] which he built. <sup class="v">3:4</sup>For every
house is built by some one; but he that built all things is God.
<sup class="v">3:5</sup>And Moses indeed was faithful in all his
house, as a servant, for a testimony of things to be spoken;
<sup class="v">3:6</sup>but Christ as a son over his house, whose
house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and rejoicing of the
hope.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">3:7</sup>Wherefore, as the Holy
Spirit says, To-day if you will hear his voice, <sup class=
"v">3:8</sup>harden not your hearts as in the provocation, in the
day of the trial in the wilderness, <sup class="v">3:9</sup>where
your fathers fully proved and saw my works forty years. <sup class=
"v">3:10</sup>Wherefore I was displeased with that generation and
said, They always err in mind, and they did not know my ways,
<sup class="v">3:11</sup>so I swore in my wrath, They shall not
enter into my rest. <sup class="v">3:12</sup>See, brothers, that
there be not at any time in any one of you an evil mind of unbelief
in departing from the living God; <sup class="v">3:13</sup>but
exhort one another daily, while it is called to-day, that no one of
you may be hardened by the deception of sin; <sup class=
"v">3:14</sup>for we have been made partakers of Christ, if we hold
the beginning of the confidence firm to the end. <sup class=
"v">3:15</sup>It was said, To-day if you will hear his voice,
harden not your hearts as in the provocation; <sup class=
"v">3:16</sup>for who having heard committed provocation? Did not
all indeed who came out of Egypt with Moses? <sup class=
"v">3:17</sup>And with whom was he displeased forty years? Was it
not with those that sinned? whose bodies fell in the wilderness?
<sup class="v">3:18</sup>And to whom did he swear that they should
not enter into his rest? was it not to them that disobeyed?
<sup class="v">3:19</sup>And we see that they could not enter in
because of unbelief.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">4:1</sup>Let us fear, therefore,
lest at any time a promise being left us of entering into his rest,
any one of you should seem to come short. <sup class=
"v">4:2</sup>For we have also received the good news as they did;
but the word of the report did not profit them, not being
accompanied with faith in those who heard. <sup class=
"v">4:3</sup>For we enter into the rest who believed, as he said, I
swore in my wrath that they shall not enter into my rest, although
of works made from the foundation of the world. <sup class=
"v">4:4</sup>For he spoke in a certain place of the seventh day,
thus; And God rested on the seventh day from all his works.
<sup class="v">4:5</sup>And in this place again, They shall not
enter into my rest. <sup class="v">4:6</sup>Since then it remains
that some entered into it, and those to whom it was first preached
entered not in on account of unbelief, <sup class=
"v">4:7</sup>again he defines a certain day, To-day, saying in
David, after so long a time, as it was said before, To-day if you
will hear his voice, harden not your hearts. <sup class=
"v">4:8</sup>For if Joshua caused them to rest he would not have
spoken of another day afterwards.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">4:9</sup>Therefore a sabbatism
remains for the people of God. <sup class="v">4:10</sup>For he
[Christ] who entered into his rest, also himself rested from his
works, as God from his.</p>
<p class="pin">8 <sup class="v">4:11</sup>Let us use diligence,
therefore to enter into that rest [the heavenly rest], that no one
may fall, after the same example of disobedience. <sup class=
"v">4:12</sup>For the word of God is living, and effective, and
sharper than any two-edged sword, and reaching even to the division
of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrows, and distinguishes
thoughts and intentions of mind; <sup class="v">4:13</sup>and there
is nothing which is not manifest in his sight; for all things are
naked and exposed to his eyes, to whom our discourse relates.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST A CHIEF PRIEST AFTER THE ORDER OF MELCHISEDEC.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">4:14</sup>HAVING therefore a
great chief priest who has gone through the heavens, Jesus, the Son
of God, let us hold fast the profession. <sup class=
"v">4:15</sup>For we have not a chief priest who cannot sympathise
with our infirmities, but one tried in all respects as we are,
without sin. <sup class="v">4:16</sup>Let us therefore approach
with boldness the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and
find grace for timely aid.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">5:1</sup>For every chief priest
taken from men is appointed in behalf of men over things relating
to God, that he may offer gifts and sacrifices for sins,
<sup class="v">5:2</sup>being able to deal gently with the ignorant
and erring, since he is himself encompassed with infirmity,
<sup class="v">5:3</sup>and as for the people, so also for himself,
he is obliged to present offerings for sins. <sup class=
"v">5:4</sup>And no one takes the honor on himself but he that is
called by God, even as Aaron also was. <sup class="v">5:5</sup>So
also Christ did not put on himself the honor of being made a chief
priest, but he that said to him, Thou art my Son, to-day have I
begotten thee; <sup class="v">5:6</sup>as also in another place he
says, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.
<sup class="v">5:7</sup>Who in the days of his flesh having offered
both prayers and supplications to him that was able to save him
from death, with loud cries and tears, [and being heard and
delivered] from fear,&mdash; <sup class="v">5:8</sup>although he
was a Son, learned obedience from what he suffered, <sup class=
"v">5:9</sup>and being made perfect became to all who obey him an
author of eternal salvation, <sup class="v">5:10</sup>being called
by God a chief priest after the order of Melchisedec.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">5:11</sup>Concerning whom we have
much to say, and that which is difficult to explain, because you
have become dull of hearing. <sup class="v">5:12</sup>For you who
ought on account of the time to be teachers, have need that one
should teach you again what are the first rudiments of the oracles
of God, and have need of milk and not solid food. <sup class=
"v">5:13</sup>For every one that partakes of milk is unskilful in
the word of righteousness, for he is a babe; <sup class=
"v">5:14</sup>but solid food is for the perfect, having their
perceptive faculties exercised by practice to distinguish both good
and evil.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">6:1</sup>Wherefore leaving the
account of the beginning of Christ, let us go on to perfection, not
laying again the foundation of a change of mind from dead works,
and of faith in God, <sup class="v">6:2</sup>of baptisms taught,
and the imposition of hands, and of the resurrection of the dead,
and of the eternal judgment. <sup class="v">6:3</sup>And this we
will do if God permits. <sup class="v">6:4</sup>For those once
enlightened and having tasted of the heavenly gift and been made
partakers of the Holy Spirit, <sup class="v">6:5</sup>and having
tasted of the good word of God and the powers of the life to come,
<sup class="v">6:6</sup>and having fallen away, it is impossible
again to renew to a change of mind, they having crucified again and
exposed to shame the Son of God. <sup class="v">6:7</sup>But the
land which drinks in the rain that often falls on it, and produces
plants beneficial to those by whom it is cultivated, receives a
blessing from God; <sup class="v">6:8</sup>but that which produces
thorns and thistles is disapproved, and is nigh to a curse, the end
of which is to be burned.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">6:9</sup>But we are persuaded
better things of you, beloved, and things pertaining to salvation,
though we thus speak. <sup class="v">6:10</sup>For God is not
unjust, to forget your work, and the love which you showed for his
name, having served the saints and [still] serving them.
<sup class="v">6:11</sup>But we desire each of you to show the same
diligence to the full assurance of hope to the end, <sup class=
"v">6:12</sup>that you be not stupid, but followers of those who
through faith and patience inherit the promises. <sup class=
"v">6:13</sup>For God haying promised Abraham, when he could not
swear by a greater, swore by himself, <sup class=
"v">6:14</sup>saying, Surely, blessing I will bless you, and
multiplying I will multiply you; <sup class="v">6:15</sup>and so
having waited long he obtained the promise. <sup class=
"v">6:16</sup>For men indeed swear by a greater, and an oath for
confirmation is to them an end of all dispute; <sup class=
"v">6:17</sup>for which cause, God wishing more abundantly to show
to the heirs of the promise the immutability of his purpose,
interposed with an oath, <sup class="v">6:18</sup>that by two
immutable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we
might have strong consolation, who fled to lay hold on the hope set
before us, <sup class="v">6:19</sup>which we have as an anchor of
the soul, sure and firm, and entering within the vail, <sup class=
"v">6:20</sup>where our forerunner Jesus entered, made after the
order of Melchisedec a chief priest forever.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">7:1</sup>For this Melchisedec,
king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham as he
returned from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,
<sup class="v">7:2</sup>to whom also Abraham gave a tenth of all,
first being interpreted king of righteousness, and then also king
of Salem, which is king of peace, <sup class="v">7:3</sup>without
father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither a
beginning of days nor end of life, but being made like the Son of
God, continues a priest forever.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">7:4</sup>And behold, how great
this man was, to whom even Abraham the patriarch gave a tenth of
the spoils. <sup class="v">7:5</sup>And the sons of Levi who
receive the priesthood, have a commandment to tithe the people
according to the law, that is their brothers, although descended
from Abraham; <sup class="v">7:6</sup>but he whose descent is not
reckoned from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him who
has the promises. <sup class="v">7:7</sup>But beyond all
contradiction, the less is blessed by the greater. <sup class=
"v">7:8</sup>And here, men who die receive tithes, but there, one
of whom it is testified that he lives. <sup class="v">7:9</sup>And
so to speak, Levi also who receives tithes paid tithes through
Abraham; <sup class="v">7:10</sup>for he was yet in his father when
Melchisedec met him.</p>
<p class="pin">8 <sup class="v">7:11</sup>If therefore there was
perfection through the Levitical priesthood,&mdash;for the people
received the law under it,&mdash;what need was there that another
priest should arise after the order of Melchisedec and not to be
called after the order of Aaron? <sup class="v">7:12</sup>For the
priesthood being changed, of necessity also there is made a change
of the law. <sup class="v">7:13</sup>For he of whom these things
are said belonged to another tribe, of which no one attended to the
altar; <sup class="v">7:14</sup>for it is evident that our Lord
arose from Judah, in respect to which tribe Moses said nothing
concerning priests. <sup class="v">7:15</sup>And moreover, [this]
is still further evident, if another priest is raised up according
to the likeness of Melchisedec, <sup class="v">7:16</sup>who was
not a priest after the law of an external commandment, but after
the power of imperishable life. <sup class="v">7:17</sup>For it is
testified, Thou art a priest forever, after the order of
Melchisedec. <sup class="v">7:18</sup>For there is an abrogation of
the commandment which goes before, on account of its weakness and
unprofitableness; <sup class="v">7:19</sup>for the law made nothing
perfect, but was the introduction of a better hope through which we
draw nigh to God. <sup class="v">7:20</sup>And as he was not
[constituted] without swearing,&mdash; <sup class="v">7:21</sup>for
they were made priests without swearing, but he with swearing by
him who says to him, The Lord swore, and he will not change, You
are a priest forever;&mdash; <sup class="v">7:22</sup>by so much is
Jesus the pledge of a better covenant. <sup class="v">7:23</sup>And
they indeed were made many priests, on account of being forbidden
by death to continue; <sup class="v">7:24</sup>but he, on account
of his continuing for ever, has a priesthood which passes not away,
<sup class="v">7:25</sup>whence also he is able to save forever
those who come to God through him, always living to intercede for
them.</p>
<p class="pin">9 <sup class="v">7:26</sup>For such a chief priest
also was suitable for us, holy, harmless, undefiled, separated from
sinners, and made higher than the heavens, <sup class=
"v">7:27</sup>who has no need daily as the chief priests first to
present sacrifices for their sins, then for those of the people;
for this he did once for all, having offered himself. <sup class=
"v">7:28</sup>For the law constitutes men chief priests having
infirmity, but the word of the oath which is after the law the Son
made perfect forever.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<h3>CHRIST THE AUTHOR OF A NEW COVENANT AND OF ITS BLESSINGS.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">8:1</sup>BUT the chief thing in
addition to what has been said is, that we have such a chief priest
who sat on the right hand of the throne of the majesty in the
heavens, <sup class="v">8:2</sup>a minister of the sanctuary, and
of the true tabernacle, which the Lord set up, not man. <sup class=
"v">8:3</sup>For every chief priest is constituted to offer gifts
and sacrifices, whence it was necessary that this man also should
have something to offer. <sup class="v">8:4</sup>For if he had been
on earth he would not have been a priest, there being priests to
offer, the gifts according to the law, <sup class="v">8:5</sup>who
serve for a symbol and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was
divinely instructed when about to make the tabernacle; for see, he
says, that you make all things after the pattern shown you in the
Mount; <sup class="v">8:6</sup>but now he has obtained a more
excellent service, by as much also as he is the mediator of a
better covenant, which is established on better promises.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">8:7</sup>For if that first
covenant had been faultless, no place would have been sought for
the second. [But it was not]. <sup class="v">8:8</sup>For finding
fault with them he says, Behold, the days come, says the Lord, that
I will make with the house of Israel and the house of Judah, a new
covenant, <sup class="v">8:9</sup>not according to the covenant
which I made with their fathers, in the day that I took them by the
hand to lead them out of Egypt, for they continued not in my
covenant, and I neglected them, says the Lord. <sup class=
"v">8:10</sup>This is the covenant that I will make with the house
of Israel after those days, says the Lord; I will put my laws in
their minds, and will write them in their hearts, and I will be to
them a God, and they shall be to me a people. <sup class=
"v">8:11</sup>And they shall not teach every one his [fellow]
citizen, and every one his brother, saying, Know the Lord, for all
shall know me, from the least to the greatest of them. <sup class=
"v">8:12</sup>For I will be merciful to their wickedness, and their
sins and transgressions will I remember no more. <sup class=
"v">8:13</sup>By saying new, he made the first old; but that which
is ancient and weak is about to perish.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">9:1</sup>The first covenant then
had ordinances of divine service and a worldly sanctuary.
<sup class="v">9:2</sup>For the first tabernacle was provided, in
which were the candlestick and the table and the show bread, which
is called the sanctuary. <sup class="v">9:3</sup>But behind the
second vail is the tabernacle, called the inner sanctuary,
<sup class="v">9:4</sup>having the golden censer and the ark of the
covenant overlaid on every side with gold, in which were the golden
vase that had the manna and Aaron's rod that budded and the tables
of the covenant, <sup class="v">9:5</sup>and over it were the
cherubs of glory, overshadowing the propitiation; of which it is
not necessary now to speak particularly.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">9:6</sup>And these being thus
provided, the priests enter into the first tabernacle continually,
performing the services, <sup class="v">9:7</sup>but into the
second once a year only the chief priest [enters], not without
blood, which he offers for his errors and those of the people,
<sup class="v">9:8</sup>the Holy Spirit showing this, that the way
into the sanctuary is not made manifest while the first tabernacle
yet has a standing, <sup class="v">9:9</sup>which is a type of the
time at hand, in which gifts and sacrifices are offered that cannot
perfect the worshipper as to the conscience, <sup class=
"v">9:10</sup>only in meats and drinks and different baptisms, and
external ordinances, imposed till the time of reformation.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">9:11</sup>But Christ having come,
a chief priest of the good times that were to come, with a greater
and a more perfect tabernacle not made with hands, that is, not of
this creation, <sup class="v">9:12</sup>not with blood of goats and
bullocks, but with his own blood, entered once into the sanctuary
having found eternal redemption. <sup class="v">9:13</sup>For if
the blood of bulls and goats, and the ashes of a heifer, sprinkling
the defiled, sanctifies to the purification of the flesh,
<sup class="v">9:14</sup>how much more shall the blood of Christ,
who with an eternal spirit offered himself without fault to God,
purify your conscience from dead works to serve the living God.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">9:15</sup>And for this cause he
is the mediator of the new covenant, that death having been for a
redemption of transgressions [transgressors] under the first
covenant, the called might receive the promise of the eternal
inheritance. <sup class="v">9:16</sup>For where there is a
covenant, there must follow the death of the covenant-maker.
<sup class="v">9:17</sup>For a covenant is strong for the dead,
since it is never strong [unalterable] when the covenant-maker
lives; <sup class="v">9:18</sup>whence also the first [covenant]
was not initiated without blood. <sup class="v">9:19</sup>For every
commandment of the law having been spoken by Moses to all the
people, taking the blood of bullocks and goats with water and
scarlet wool and hyssop, he sprinkled both the book itself and all
the people, <sup class="v">9:20</sup>saying, This is the blood of
the covenant which God has enjoined upon you. <sup class=
"v">9:21</sup>And he sprinkled also the tabernacle, and all the
implements of the service, in like manner, with blood. <sup class=
"v">9:22</sup>And almost all things, according to the law, are
purified with blood, and without the pouring out of blood there is
no forgiveness.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">9:23</sup>It was necessary,
therefore, that the symbols of things in the heavens should be
purified with these, but the heavenly things themselves with better
sacrifices than these. <sup class="v">9:24</sup>For Christ did not
enter into the sanctuary made with hands, a type of the true, but
into heaven itself, and already has appeared before God for us,
<sup class="v">9:25</sup>not that he may often present himself, as
the chief priest enters into the sanctuary once a year with the
blood of another [being]; <sup class="v">9:26</sup>since it was
necessary that it should suffer often from the foundation of the
world, but now once at the consummation of the world he has been
manifested to destroy sins by the sacrifice of himself. <sup class=
"v">9:27</sup>And as it is appointed to men once to die, but after
this is the judgment, <sup class="v">9:28</sup>so also Christ
having been once offered to bear the sins of many, shall appear a
second time without sin, to those who look for him for
salvation.</p>
<p class="pin">8 <sup class="v">10:1</sup>For the law having a
shadow of the good things that were to come, not the very likeness
of the things, could not by the sacrifices which they offered
continually every year perfect the offerers; <sup class=
"v">10:2</sup>if they could, would they not have ceased to be
offered, because those serving would have had no longer a knowledge
of sins, having been once purified? <sup class="v">10:3</sup>But in
them there was a remembrance of sins, year by year; <sup class=
"v">10:4</sup>for it is impossible that the blood of bulls and
goats should take away sins. <sup class="v">10:5</sup>Wherefore,
coming into the world, he says, A sacrifice and offering thou didst
not desire, but a body didst thou prepare me. <sup class=
"v">10:6</sup>Whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou
wast not pleased with; <sup class="v">10:7</sup>then I said,
Behold, I come,&mdash;in the volume of the book it is written of
me,&mdash;to do thy will, O God. <sup class="v">10:8</sup>Saying
before, Sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and
[sacrifices] for sin thou didst not desire and wast not pleased
with, which are offered according to the law, <sup class=
"v">10:9</sup>then he said, Behold, I come to do thy will. He takes
away the first, that he may establish the second, <sup class=
"v">10:10</sup>by which will we have been sanctified through the
offering of the body of Jesus Christ, once for all.</p>
<p class="pin">9 <sup class="v">10:11</sup>And every priest stood
daily performing service and presenting often the same sacrifices,
which can never take away sins; <sup class="v">10:12</sup>but this
[priest] having offered one sacrifice forever for sins, sat down on
the right hand of God, <sup class="v">10:13</sup>henceforth waiting
till his enemies are made his footstool. <sup class=
"v">10:14</sup>For by one offering he has perfected forever the
sanctified. <sup class="v">10:15</sup>The Holy Spirit also
testifies [this] to us; for after it had said before, <sup class=
"v">10:16</sup>This is the covenant which I will make with them
after those days, the Lord says, I will put my laws in their
hearts, and in their minds will I write them, <sup class=
"v">10:17</sup>and their sins and transgressions will I remember no
more. <sup class="v">10:18</sup>But where there is a forgiveness of
these, an offering for sin is no longer required.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<h3>THE CONTEMPLATION OF CHRIST, FAITH AND ITS MARTYRS.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">10:19</sup>HAVING therefore,
brothers, confidence in respect to the entrance into the sanctuary
by the blood of Jesus, <sup class="v">10:20</sup>which [entrance]
he consecrated for us a new and living way through the vail, that
is his flesh, <sup class="v">10:21</sup>and [having] a great priest
over the house of God, <sup class="v">10:22</sup>let us approach
with a true heart in a full assurance of faith, sprinkled in heart
from an evil conscience, and washed in body with pure water,
<sup class="v">10:23</sup>let us hold firmly the profession of the
faith, without declining; for he is faithful that promised;
<sup class="v">10:24</sup>and let us observe one another for a
provocation of love and of good works, <sup class=
"v">10:25</sup>not forsaking our own congregation as some are in
the habit of [doing], but exhorting [others], and so much the more
as you see the day approaching.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">10:26</sup>For if we sin
willingly after having received the knowledge of the truth, there
is no longer a sacrifice left for sins, <sup class=
"v">10:27</sup>but a fearful expectation of judgment and fiery
indignation, which is about to consume the adversaries. <sup class=
"v">10:28</sup>Any one who despised the law of Moses died without
mercy by two or three witnesses; <sup class="v">10:29</sup>of how
much greater punishment do you suppose he will be thought worthy,
who has trodden down the Son of God, and accounted defiled the
blood of the covenant with which he was purified, and treated
injuriously the Spirit of grace. <sup class="v">10:30</sup>For we
know him that said, Judgment belongs to me, I will repay. And
again, The Lord will judge his people. <sup class="v">10:31</sup>It
is fearful to fall into the hands of the living God.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">10:32</sup>But remember the
former days, in which having been enlightened you endured a great
conflict with sufferings, <sup class="v">10:33</sup>partly in being
made a spectacle by reproaches and afflictions, and partly being
companions of those so treated. <sup class="v">10:34</sup>For you
sympathized with those in bonds, and received with joy the plunder
of your property, knowing that you have for yourselves a better
possession, and one that endures. <sup class="v">10:35</sup>Cast
not away therefore your confidence, which has a great reward.
<sup class="v">10:36</sup>For you have need of patience, that
having done the will of God you may receive the promise.
<sup class="v">10:37</sup>For yet a very little while, and he that
is to come will come and will not delay; <sup class=
"v">10:38</sup>but my righteous one shall live by faith, and if he
draws back my soul takes no pleasure in him. <sup class=
"v">10:39</sup>But we are not of those who draw back to perdition,
but of faith to the saving of the soul.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">11:1</sup>But faith is a
confidence in respect to things hoped for, a conviction of things
not seen. <sup class="v">11:2</sup>For by it the ancients obtained
a good repute. <sup class="v">11:3</sup>We know by faith that the
worlds were made by the word of God, that the seen was not made
from the apparent. <sup class="v">11:4</sup>By faith Abel offered
to God a greater sacrifice than Cain, through which he was declared
to be righteous, God testifying to his gifts, and through the same,
having died, he speaks still. <sup class="v">11:5</sup>By faith
Enoch was translated without seeing death, and was not found
because God translated him. For before the translation he was said
to have pleased God; <sup class="v">11:6</sup>but without faith it
is impossible to please; for he that comes to God, must believe
that he is and that he is a rewarder of those that seek him.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">11:7</sup>By faith Noah having
been divinely instructed concerning things not yet seen, fearing
built the ark for the salvation of his house, by which he condemned
the world, and became an heir of the righteousness by faith.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">11:8</sup>By faith Abraham being
called obeyed and went out to a place which he was to receive for
an inheritance, and went out not knowing where he was going.
<sup class="v">11:9</sup>By faith he resided temporarily in the
land of promise, as in a foreign land, living in tents, with Isaac
and Jacob, co-heirs of the same promise; <sup class=
"v">11:10</sup>for he looked for the city which has foundations
[fixed abodes] whose designer and builder is God. <sup class=
"v">11:11</sup>By faith also Sarah herself received power to become
a mother, even beyond the usual age, because she regarded him
faithful that promised. <sup class="v">11:12</sup>Wherefore also
there were born of one, and those of one dead, [a posterity] like
the stars of heaven for multitude, and like the sands on the
sea-shore innumerable.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">11:13</sup>All these died in
faith not having received the promises, but having seen and saluted
them from a distance, and having professed that they were
foreigners and strangers on the earth. <sup class=
"v">11:14</sup>For those who say such things show that they seek a
native country. <sup class="v">11:15</sup>And if they had
remembered that country from which they went out, they would have
had opportunity to return; <sup class="v">11:16</sup>but now they
seek a better, that is a heavenly [country]. Wherefore God is not
ashamed of them to be called their God; for he has prepared for
them a city.</p>
<p class="pin">8 <sup class="v">11:17</sup>By faith Abraham when
tried offered Isaac, and he that received the promises offered his
only son, <sup class="v">11:18</sup>of whom it was said, In Isaac
shall your posterity be called, <sup class="v">11:19</sup>judging
that God was able to raise even from the dead; whence also in a
figure he received him. <sup class="v">11:20</sup>By faith also
Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau in respect to things to come.
<sup class="v">11:21</sup>By faith Jacob dying, blessed each of the
sons of Joseph and worshipped leaning on the top of his staff.
<sup class="v">11:22</sup>By faith Joseph at the close of life made
mention of the exodus of the children of Israel and gave charge
concerning his bones.</p>
<p class="pin">9 <sup class="v">11:23</sup>By faith Moses when he
was born was hid three months by his parents, because they saw that
the child was beautiful, and they feared not the command of the
king. <sup class="v">11:24</sup>By faith Moses when he became a man
refused to be called a son of Pharaoh's daughter, <sup class=
"v">11:25</sup>choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people
of God, than to have an enjoyment of sin for a time, <sup class=
"v">11:26</sup>judging the reproach of Christ greater riches than
the treasures of Egypt; for he had respect to the reward.
<sup class="v">11:27</sup>By faith he left Egypt, not having feared
the displeasure of the king; for he endured as seeing him that is
invisible. <sup class="v">11:28</sup>By faith he observed the
passover and the pouring out of blood, that the destroyer of the
first-born might not touch them. <sup class="v">11:29</sup>By faith
they passed through the Red Sea as through dry land, which the
Egyptians attempting were swallowed up. <sup class=
"v">11:30</sup>By faith the walls of Jericho fell down when they
had been surrounded seven days. <sup class="v">11:31</sup>By faith
Rahab the harlot escaped destruction with the disobedient, having
received the spies in peace.</p>
<p class="pin">10 <sup class="v">11:32</sup>And why should I say
more? For time would fail me to relate of Gideon and Barak, and
Sampson and Jepthah, and David and Samuel and the prophets,
<sup class="v">11:33</sup>who by faith subdued kingdoms, performed
righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,
<sup class="v">11:34</sup>extinguished the power of fire, escaped
the edge of the sword, from weakness were made strong, became
mighty in war, put to flight encampments of foreigners; <sup class=
"v">11:35</sup>women received their dead from a resurrection,
others were tortured having not accepted redemption, that they
might obtain a better resurrection; <sup class="v">11:36</sup>and
others had trial of mockings and scourges, and besides of bonds and
imprisonment; <sup class="v">11:37</sup>they were stoned, they were
cut to pieces with saws, they were tried, they died with the death
of the sword, they wandered about in sheep-skins and goat-skins,
destitute, afflicted, injuriously treated, <sup class=
"v">11:38</sup>of whom the world was not worthy, wandering in
deserts and mountains, and in caves and openings of the earth.
<sup class="v">11:39</sup>And none of these who became martyrs
through faith received the promise, <sup class="v">11:40</sup>God
having provided something better for us, that they without us
should not be made perfect.</p>
<p class="pin">11 <sup class="v">12:1</sup>Therefore also we,
having so great a cloud of witnesses lying around us, laying aside
every impediment and sin which entirely surrounds us, let us run
with patience the race set before us, <sup class=
"v">12:2</sup>looking to the chief guide and perfecter of the
faith, Jesus, who for the joy set before him despised the shame and
endured the cross, and sat down on the right hand of God.
<sup class="v">12:3</sup>For consider him that has endured such a
contradiction from sinners, that you may not become faint and weary
in your minds.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>
<h3>DIVINE CHASTENING, MOUNT SINAI AND MOUNT ZION, MORAL DUTIES,
ETC.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">12:4</sup>You have not yet
resisted to blood contending against sin. <sup class=
"v">12:5</sup>And you have forgotten the exhortation which says to
you as to sons, My son, despise not the correction of the Lord and
faint not when rebuked by him, <sup class="v">12:6</sup>for the
Lord corrects those whom he loves, and chastises every son whom he
receives. <sup class="v">12:7</sup>If you endure correction, God
deals with you as sons; for what son is there whom his father does
not correct? <sup class="v">12:8</sup>But if you are without
correction of which all are partakers, then you are of foreign
birth, and not sons. <sup class="v">12:9</sup>Moreover, we have had
fathers of our flesh who corrected us and we respected them; shall
we not much more be subject to the Father of spirits and live?
<sup class="v">12:10</sup>For they for a few days corrected us as
seemed good to them, but he for the best, that we may partake of
his holiness. <sup class="v">12:11</sup>And no correction seems to
be joyful for the present but painful, but afterwards it yields the
peaceful fruit of righteousness to those exercised by it.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">12:12</sup>Wherefore hold up the
hands that hang down, and the feeble knees, <sup class=
"v">12:13</sup>and make straight courses for your feet, that the
lame may not be turned out of the way, but may rather be healed.
<sup class="v">12:14</sup>Follow peace with all men and holiness,
without which no one shall see the Lord, <sup class=
"v">12:15</sup>taking care that no one may come short of the grace
of God, that no root of bitterness springing up may make trouble
and by it many be defiled, <sup class="v">12:16</sup>that no one
may be a fornicator or unholy person like Esau, who for one meal
sold his birthright. <sup class="v">12:17</sup>For you know that
afterwards, wishing also to inherit the blessing, he was rejected;
for he found no place for a change of mind, though he sought it
with tears. <sup class="v">12:18</sup>For you have not come to a
mountain that may be touched, and to a burning fire, and blackness
and darkness and a tempest <sup class="v">12:19</sup>and the sound
of a trumpet and the voice of words, which those who heard desired
that the word might not be spoken to them any more,&mdash;
<sup class="v">12:20</sup>for they could not bear what was
commanded, And if a beast touches the mountain it shall be stoned;
<sup class="v">12:21</sup>and so fearful was the sight, that Moses
said, I fear and tremble,&mdash; <sup class="v">12:22</sup>but you
have come to Zion, the mountain and city of the living God, the
heavenly Jerusalem, and to myriads of angels in general assembly,
<sup class="v">12:23</sup>and to the church of the first-born who
are enrolled in heaven, and to a judge the God of all, and to
spirits of the righteous made perfect, <sup class=
"v">12:24</sup>and to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and
to a sprinkled blood which speaks better than Abel.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">12:25</sup>See that you refuse
not him that speaks; for if they did not escape who refused him
that gave answers on earth, much more shall we [not escape] who
turn ourselves away from him in heaven; <sup class=
"v">12:26</sup>whose voice then shook the earth, but now it has
been promised, saying, Hereafter once for all I will shake not only
the earth, but also heaven. <sup class="v">12:27</sup>And this,
Hereafter once for all, signifies the removal of the things shaken
as of things made, that those not shaken may continue. <sup class=
"v">12:28</sup>Wherefore, receiving a kingdom that cannot be
shaken, let us have grace through which we may serve God
acceptably, with piety and fear; <sup class="v">12:29</sup>for our
God is also a consuming fire.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">13:1</sup>Let brotherly love
continue. <sup class="v">13:2</sup>Forget not hospitality; for by
this some without knowing it have entertained angels. <sup class=
"v">13:3</sup>Remember those bound as bound with them, and those
injured as being yourselves also in the body. <sup class=
"v">13:4</sup>Marriage is honorable in all, and married life
without blame; but fornicators and adulterers God will judge.
<sup class="v">13:5</sup>Let your life be without avarice, and be
contented with what you have; for he said, I will never leave you,
I will never forsake you; <sup class="v">13:6</sup>so that we may
boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear; what can
man do to me?</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">13:7</sup>Remember your guides
who spoke to you the word of God, and considering the end of their
life follow the faith. <sup class="v">13:8</sup>Jesus Christ is the
same yesterday, to-day, and forever. <sup class="v">13:9</sup>Be
not carried about with various and strange doctrines; for it is
good that the mind should be established with grace, not with
aliments, in which those walking are not profited.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">13:10</sup>We have an altar of
which those who serve the tabernacle have no right to eat.
<sup class="v">13:11</sup>For the bodies of those animals whose
blood is carried into the sanctuary by the chief priest are burnt
without the encampment. <sup class="v">13:12</sup>Wherefore also
Jesus, that he might purify the people through his blood, suffered
without the gate. <sup class="v">13:13</sup>Let us therefore go out
to him without the encampment, bearing his reproach; <sup class=
"v">13:14</sup>for we have not here a city that continues, but we
seek that which is to come. <sup class="v">13:15</sup>Through him,
therefore, let us offer the sacrifice of praise continually to God,
that is, the fruit of lips confessing his name. <sup class=
"v">13:16</sup>And forget not beneficence and liberality; for with
such sacrifices God is well pleased.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">13:17</sup>Obey your guides and
be in subjection; for they watch for your souls as having to give
an account, that they may do this with joy and not with grief; for
this is unprofitable for you.</p>
<p class="pin">8 <sup class="v">13:18</sup>Pray for us; for we
trust we have a good conscience, in all things wishing to live
well. <sup class="v">13:19</sup>And I exhort you do this the more,
that I may sooner be restored to you.</p>
<p class="pin">9 <sup class="v">13:20</sup>And may the God of
peace, who brought up from the dead the great shepherd of the sheep
with the blood of the eternal covenant, our Lord Jesus, <sup class=
"v">13:21</sup>perfect you in every good work to do his will, doing
in you that which is pleasing in his sight through Jesus Christ, to
whom be the glory forever; amen.</p>
<p class="pin">10 <sup class="v">13:22</sup>And I beseech you,
brothers, suffer the word of exhortation; for I have sent to you a
letter in a few words. <sup class="v">13:23</sup>Know that brother
Timothy has been released, with whom, if he comes soon, I will see
you. <sup class="v">13:24</sup>Salute all your guides and all the
saints. Those from Italy salute you. <sup class="v">13:25</sup>The
grace be with you all; amen.</p>

<h3>INTRODUCTION, A VISION OF CHRIST</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">1:1</sup>A REVELATION of Jesus
Christ, which God gave him, to show his servants [things] which
must shortly occur, and he sent and made them known by his angel to
his servant John, <sup class="v">1:2</sup>who declared the word of
God and the testimony of Jesus Christ which he saw. <sup class=
"v">1:3</sup>Blessed is he that reads, and those that hear the
words of the prophecy, and keep the things written in it; for the
time is at hand.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">1:4</sup>John, to the seven
churches in Asia. Grace and peace be to you, from the Is and the
Was and the Is to come, and from the seven spirits which are before
his throne, <sup class="v">1:5</sup>and from Jesus Christ, the
faithful witness, the first born from the dead, and the ruler of
the kings of the earth. To him that loved us and washed us from our
sins with his blood, <sup class="v">1:6</sup>and made us a kingdom,
priests to God even his Father, to him be the glory and the power
forever; amen.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">1:7</sup>Behold, he comes with

and all the tribes of the earth shall mourn because of him. Yes,
amen. <sup class="v">1:8</sup>I am the Alpha and the Omega, says
the Lord God; the Is, and the Was, and the Is to come, the
Almighty.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">1:9</sup>I, John, your brother
and companion in the affliction and kingdom and patience in Christ
Jesus, was in the island called Patmos on account of the word of
God and the testimony of Jesus. <sup class="v">1:10</sup>I was in
the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a loud voice as
of a trumpet, <sup class="v">1:11</sup>saying, What you see write
in a book, and send to the seven churches, to Ephesus and to Smyrna
and to Pergamus and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia
and to Laodicea.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">1:12</sup>And I turned to see the
voice which spoke with me; and having turned around I saw seven
golden candlesticks, <sup class="v">1:13</sup>and in the midst of
the candlesticks one like the Son of man, clothed with a robe
extending down to his feet, girded about the breasts with a golden
girdle; <sup class="v">1:14</sup>and his head and hairs were white
as white wool, as snow, and his eyes like a flame of fire,
<sup class="v">1:15</sup>and his feet like fine brass as if they
were burned in a furnace, and his voice like the sound of many
waters, <sup class="v">1:16</sup>and he had in his right hand seven
stars, and out of his mouth proceeded a sharp two-edged sword, and
his face shone like the sun in his strength.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">1:17</sup>And when I saw him I
fell at his feet as dead; and he put his right hand on me, saying,
Fear not; I am the first and the last <sup class="v">1:18</sup>and
the living, and I was dead, and behold, I am living forever and
ever; and I have the keys of death and of hades. <sup class=
"v">1:19</sup>Write therefore the things which you saw, and which
are, and which are about to appear hereafter, <sup class=
"v">1:20</sup>the mystery of the seven stars which you saw in my
right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are
angels of the seven churches, and the seven candlesticks the seven
churches.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<h3>LETTERS TO THE SEVEN CHURCHES.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">2:1</sup>To the angel of the
church in Ephesus write, These things says he that holds the seven
stars in his right hand, who walks in the midst of the seven golden
candlesticks, <sup class="v">2:2</sup>I know your works and your
labor and your patience, and that you cannot bear the wicked, and
you tried those who say they are apostles and are not, and found
them false; <sup class="v">2:3</sup>and you have patience, and
suffered for my name, and did not faint. <sup class=
"v">2:4</sup>But I have against you that you have left your first
love. <sup class="v">2:5</sup>Remember therefore whence you have
fallen, and change your minds, and do the first works, otherwise I
will come to you and remove your candlestick from its place, unless
you change your minds. <sup class="v">2:6</sup>But you have this,
that you hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.
<sup class="v">2:7</sup>Let him that has an ear hear what the
Spirit says to the churches; To him that conquers will I give to
eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of my God.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">2:8</sup>And to the angel of the
church in Smyrna write, These things says the first and the last,
who was dead and lived, <sup class="v">2:9</sup>I know your
affliction and poverty, but you are rich, and the blasphemy of
those who say they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of
Satan. <sup class="v">2:10</sup>Fear not what you are about to
suffer. Behold, the devil is about to cast some of you into prison,
that you may be tried, and you shall have affliction ten days. Be
faithful till death, and I will give you the crown of life.
<sup class="v">2:11</sup>Let him that has an ear hear what the
Spirit says to the churches; He that conquers shall not be injured
by the second death.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">2:12</sup>And to the angel of the
church in Pergamus write, These things says he that has the
two-edged sharp sword, <sup class="v">2:13</sup>I know your works
and where you live; where Satan's throne is; and you hold my name,
and did not deny my faith in the days in which Antipas my faithful
martyr was killed among you, where Satan dwells. <sup class=
"v">2:14</sup>But I have a few things against you; you have there
those who hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balak to put an
occasion of sin before the children of Israel, both to eat things
offered to idols and to commit fornication. <sup class=
"v">2:15</sup>So in like manner you have also those who hold the
doctrine of the Nicolaitans. <sup class="v">2:16</sup>Change your
minds therefore; otherwise I will come to you quickly, and fight
with them with the sword of my mouth. <sup class="v">2:17</sup>Let
him that has an ear hear what the Spirit says to the churches; To
him that conquers will I give of the hidden manna, and I will give
him a white token, and on the token a new name engraved, which no
one knows but he that receives it.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">2:18</sup>And to the angel of the
church in Thyatira write, These things says the Son of God, he that
has his eyes like a flame of fire and his feet like fine brass,
<sup class="v">2:19</sup>I know your works and love and faith and
service and your patience, and your last works more than the first.
<sup class="v">2:20</sup>But I have against you that you allow your
wife Jezebel, who says she is a prophetess and teaches and deceives
my servants to commit fornication and eat things offered to idols.
<sup class="v">2:21</sup>And I gave her time to change her mind,
and she will not change her mind from her fornication. <sup class=
"v">2:22</sup>Behold, I will cast her on a [sick] bed, and those
committing adultery with her into great affliction, unless they
change their minds from her works. <sup class="v">2:23</sup>And her
children will I kill with pestilence, and all the churches shall
know that I am he that searches the minds and hearts, and I will
give you each one according to your works. <sup class=
"v">2:24</sup>But I say to the rest of you in Thyatira who have not
this doctrine, who have not known the depths of Satan, as they say,
I will put on you no other burden; <sup class="v">2:25</sup>but
what you have, hold fast till I come. <sup class="v">2:26</sup>And
to him that conquers and keeps my works till the end, I will give
power over the nations, <sup class="v">2:27</sup>and he shall rule
them with a rod of iron, and crush them like earthen vessels, as I
also have received of my Father, <sup class="v">2:28</sup>and I
will give him the star of the morning. <sup class="v">2:29</sup>Let
him that has an ear hear what the Spirit says to the churches.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">3:1</sup>And to the angel of the
church in Sardis write, These things says he that has the seven
spirits of God and the seven stars, I know your works, that you
have a name to live, and are dead. <sup class="v">3:2</sup>Be
watchful, confirm the rest who are about to die. For I have not
found your works perfect before my God. <sup class=
"v">3:3</sup>Remember therefore how you have received and heard,
and watch, and change your minds. If therefore you do not watch, I
will come as a thief, and you shall not know at what hour I will
come upon you. <sup class="v">3:4</sup>But you have a few names in
Sardis who have not defiled their garments, and they shall walk
with me in white, for they are worthy. <sup class="v">3:5</sup>He
that conquers shall be clothed in white robes, and I will not
obliterate his name from the book of life, and I will confess his
name before my Father and before his angels. <sup class=
"v">3:6</sup>Let him that has an ear hear what the Spirit says to
the churches.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">3:7</sup>And to the angel of the
church in Philadelphia write, These things says the Holy One, the
True, he that has the key of David, he that opens and no one shall
shut, and shuts and no one shall open, <sup class="v">3:8</sup>I
know your works; behold, I have placed before you an opened door,
which no man can shut; because you have a little power, and kept my
word, and did not deny my name. <sup class="v">3:9</sup>Behold, I
will make those of the synagogue of Satan who say they are Jews,
and are not, but lie, behold, I will make them come and worship at
your feet, and they shall know that I have loved you. <sup class=
"v">3:10</sup>Because you have kept the word of my patience, I also
will keep you from the hour of trial which is to come on all the
world, to try those who dwell on the earth. <sup class=
"v">3:11</sup>I come quickly; keep what you have, that no man may
take your crown. <sup class="v">3:12</sup>Him that overcomes will I
make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go out of it no
more, and I will write on him the name of my God and the name of
the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which comes down out of
heaven from my God, and my new name. <sup class="v">3:13</sup>Let
him that has an ear hear what the Spirit says to the churches.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">3:14</sup>And to the angel of the
church in Laodicea write, These things says the Amen, the faithful
and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God, <sup class=
"v">3:15</sup>I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot.
I wish you were cold or hot. <sup class="v">3:16</sup>Because
therefore you are warm, and neither hot nor cold, I am about to
spew you out of my mouth. <sup class="v">3:17</sup>For you say, I
am rich and have become rich and have need of nothing, and know not
that you are miserable, and pitiable, and poor, and blind, and
naked. <sup class="v">3:18</sup>I advise you to buy of me gold
purified in the fire that you may be rich, and white robes that you
may put on, and the shame of your nakedness not appear, and an
eye-salve to anoint your eyes that you may see. <sup class=
"v">3:19</sup>As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten; be zealous
therefore and change your minds. <sup class="v">3:20</sup>Behold, I
stand at the door and knock; if any one shall hear my voice and
open the door, I will enter in to him, and feast with him, and he
with me. <sup class="v">3:21</sup>To him that conquers will I give
to sit down with me on my throne, as I conquered and sat down with
my Father on his throne. <sup class="v">3:22</sup>Let him that has
an ear hear what the Spirit says to the churches.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<h3>THE HEAVENLY WORLD, THE THRONE OF GOD AND HIS COURT&mdash;THE
ELDERS, CHERUBS, SEALED BOOK, LAMB, ETC.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">4:1</sup>AFTER this I saw, and
behold, a door was opened in heaven, and the first voice which I
heard was of a trumpet speaking to me, saying, Come up hither, and
I will show you things that must occur hereafter. <sup class=
"v">4:2</sup>And immediately I was in the Spirit; and behold, a
throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne. <sup class=
"v">4:3</sup>And he that sat was like a jasper and sardine stone,
and there was an iris about the throne, similar in appearance to an
emerald. <sup class="v">4:4</sup>And about the throne were
twenty-four thrones; and on the thrones twenty-four elders sitting
clothed in white robes, and having crowns of gold on their
heads.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">4:5</sup>And there proceeded from
the throne lightnings and voices and thunders; and seven lamps of
fire were burning before the throne, which are the seven spirits of
God, <sup class="v">4:6</sup>and before the throne was as it were a
sea of glass like crystal; and in the midst of the throne and about
the throne were four living ones [cherubs] full of eyes before and
behind. <sup class="v">4:7</sup>And the first cherub was like a
lion, and the second cherub like a bullock, and the third cherub
had the face of a man, and the fourth cherub was like a flying
eagle.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">4:8</sup>And the four cherubs had
each six wings apiece. And they were full of eyes around and
within, and they had no rest day nor night, saying, Holy, holy,
holy is the Lord God Almighty the Was and the Is and the Is to
come. <sup class="v">4:9</sup>And when the cherubs gave glory and
honor and thanks to him that sat on the throne who lives forever
and ever, <sup class="v">4:10</sup>the twenty-four elders fell down
on their faces before him that sat on the throne, and worshipped
him that lives forever and ever, and cast their crowns before his
throne, saying, <sup class="v">4:11</sup>Thou art worthy, our Lord
and God, to receive glory and honor and power, for thou hast
created all things, and on account of thy will they are and were
created.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">5:1</sup>And I saw at the right
hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the
backside, sealed with seven seals. <sup class="v">5:2</sup>And I
saw a mighty angel proclaim with a loud voice, Who is worthy to
open the book and to break its seven seals? <sup class=
"v">5:3</sup>And no one in heaven above, nor on the earth, nor
under the earth, could open the book, or look in it. <sup class=
"v">5:4</sup>And I wept much because no one was found worthy to
open the book or to look in it. <sup class="v">5:5</sup>And one of
the elders said to me, Weep not; behold, the lion of the tribe of
Judah, the root of David, has conquered, he is opening the book and
its seven seals.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">5:6</sup>And I saw in the midst
of the throne and of the four cherubs and in the midst of the
elders, a lamb standing as if killed, having seven horns and seven
eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent into all the earth.
<sup class="v">5:7</sup>And he came and took [the book] from the
right hand of him that sat on the throne.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">5:8</sup>And when he took the
book, the four cherubs and the twenty-four elders fell down before
the lamb, each having a harp and golden bowls full of incense,
which is the prayers of the saints: <sup class="v">5:9</sup>And
they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book and
to open its seals, for thou wast killed and hast redeemed to God
with thy blood [men] from every tribe and tongue and people and
nation, <sup class="v">5:10</sup>and hast made them a kingdom and
priests, and they shall reign on the earth. <sup class=
"v">5:11</sup>And I saw, and heard a voice of many angels about the
throne, and of the cherubs, and of the elders,&mdash;and the number
of them was ten thousands of ten thousands and thousands of
thousands,&mdash; <sup class="v">5:12</sup>saying with a loud
voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was killed to receive power, and
riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honor, and glory, and
blessing. <sup class="v">5:13</sup>And every creature which is in
heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and those which are
on the sea, and all things in them, all heard I saying, To him that
sits on the throne and to the Lamb be blessing and honor and glory
and power forever and ever. <sup class="v">5:14</sup>And the four
cherubs said, Amen. And the elders fell down and worshipped:</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<h3>THE FIRST SIX SEALS OF THE BOOK OF PROPHECY, THE SEALING OF
GOD'S SERVANTS, ETC.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">6:1</sup>AND I saw when the Lamb
opened one of the seven seals, and heard one of the four cherubs
say like the sound of thunder, Come. <sup class="v">6:2</sup>And I
saw, and behold, a white horse, and he that sat on it had a bow,
and a crown was given him, and he went forth conquering and to
conquer.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">6:3</sup>And when he opened the
second seal, I heard the second cherub say, Come. <sup class=
"v">6:4</sup>And there went out another fiery horse, and it was
given to him that sat on it to take peace from the earth, and that
they should kill one another, and there was given him a great
sword.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">6:5</sup>And when he opened the
third seal, I heard the third cherub say, Come. And I saw, and
behold, a black horse, and he that sat on it had a pair of scales
in his hand. <sup class="v">6:6</sup>And I heard a voice in the
midst of the four cherubs, saying, A choenix [a quart] of wheat for
a denarius [14 cents], and three choenices of barley for a
denarius; and injure not the oil and wine.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">6:7</sup>And when he opened the
fourth seal, I heard the fourth cherub say, Come. <sup class=
"v">6:8</sup>And I saw, and behold, a pale horse, and one sat on
it, whose name was Death, and Hades followed him, and there was
given him power over a fourth part of the earth to kill with the
sword and with famine and with pestilence and by the beasts of the
earth.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">6:9</sup>And when he opened the
fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those killed for the
word of God and for the testimony which they had. <sup class=
"v">6:10</sup>And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long,
Master, holy and true, do you not judge and avenge our blood on
those that dwell on the earth? <sup class="v">6:11</sup>And a white
robe was given them, and it was told them to rest yet a little
while, till their fellow servants and their brothers and those
about to be killed as they also had been should finish [their
testimony].</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">6:12</sup>And I saw when he
opened the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake, and the
sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and all the moon became as
blood, <sup class="v">6:13</sup>and the stars of heaven fell to the
earth, as a fig tree casts down its unseasonable figs when shaken
with a mighty wind, <sup class="v">6:14</sup>and heaven departed
like a book rolled up, and every mountain and island were moved
from their places. <sup class="v">6:15</sup>And the kings of the
earth and the great men and the chiliarchs and the rich and the
mighty and every servant and freeman hid themselves in caves and in
the rocks of the mountains, <sup class="v">6:16</sup>and said to
the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of
him that sits on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb,
<sup class="v">6:17</sup>for the great day of his wrath has come,
and who can stand?</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">7:1</sup>And after this I saw
four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the
four winds of the earth, that no wind might blow on the earth, nor
on the sea, nor on any tree. <sup class="v">7:2</sup>And I saw
another angel ascend from the east, having the seal of the living
God, and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it
was given to injure the earth and the sea, <sup class=
"v">7:3</sup>saying, Injure not the earth nor the sea nor the
trees, till we seal the servants of our God on their foreheads.
<sup class="v">7:4</sup>And I heard the number of the sealed, a
hundred and forty-four thousand were sealed from every tribe of the
children of Israel.</p>
<p class="pin">8 <sup class="v">7:5</sup>From the tribe of Judah
were sealed twelve thousand, from the tribe of Reuben twelve
thousand, from the tribe of Gad twelve thousand, <sup class=
"v">7:6</sup>from the tribe of Asher twelve thousand, from the
tribe of Naphtali twelve thousand, from the tribe of Manasseh
twelve thousand, <sup class="v">7:7</sup>from the tribe of Simeon
twelve thousand, from the tribe of Levi twelve thousand, from the
tribe of Issachar twelve thousand, <sup class="v">7:8</sup>from the
tribe of Zebulon twelve thousand, from the tribe of Joseph twelve
thousand, from the tribe of Benjamin twelve thousand.</p>
<p class="pin">9 <sup class="v">7:9</sup>After this I saw, and
behold, a great multitude, which no man could number, of every
nation and of all tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before
the throne and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and
having palm branches in their hands; <sup class="v">7:10</sup>and
they cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation be to our God who
sits on the throne and to the Lamb. <sup class="v">7:11</sup>And
all the angels stood around the throne and the elders and the four
cherubs, and fell down before the throne on their faces, and
worshipped God, <sup class="v">7:12</sup>saying, Amen, blessing and
glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and strength
be to our God forever and ever.</p>
<p class="pin">10 <sup class="v">7:13</sup>And one of the elders
answered and said to me, Who are those clothed with white robes,
and whence did they come? <sup class="v">7:14</sup>And I said to
him, My Lord, you know. And he said to me, These are those who come
out from great affliction, and washed their robes and made them
white in the blood of the Lamb. <sup class="v">7:15</sup>Therefore
they are before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in
his temple, and he that sits on the throne will dwell among them.
<sup class="v">7:16</sup>And they shall hunger no more, neither
thirst any more, neither shall the sun strike them nor any heat,
<sup class="v">7:17</sup>for the Lamb who is in the midst of the
throne shall feed them and lead them to fountains of the waters of
life, and God shall wipe away every tear from their eyes.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>
<h3>THE SEVENTH SEAL, THE FIRST FIVE TRUMPETS, THE STAR THAT FELL
FROM HEAVEN, THE LOCUSTS, ETC.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">8:1</sup>AND when he opened the
seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about half an hour.
<sup class="v">8:2</sup>And I saw the seven angels who stand before
God, and there were given them seven trumpets. <sup class=
"v">8:3</sup>And another angel came and stood by the altar, having
a golden censer, and there was given him much incense to present
with the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar before the
throne. <sup class="v">8:4</sup>And a cloud of incense ascended
with the prayers of the saints from the hand of the angel before
God. <sup class="v">8:5</sup>And the angel took the censer and
filled it from the fire of the altar, and cast it on the earth; and
there were thunders and lightning and voices and an earthquake.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">8:6</sup>And the seven angels
having the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound. <sup class=
"v">8:7</sup>And the first sounded; and there was hail and fire
mingled with blood, and it was cast on the earth; and a third part
of the earth was consumed, and a third part of the trees were
consumed, and all the green grass was consumed.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">8:8</sup>And the second angel
sounded; and the appearance of a great mountain burning with fire
was cast into the sea; and a third part of the sea became blood,
<sup class="v">8:9</sup>and a third part of the creatures in the
sea having life died, and a third part of the ships were
destroyed.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">8:10</sup>And the third angel
sounded; and there fell from heaven a great star, burning like a
lamp, and it fell on a third part of the rivers and on the
fountains of waters. <sup class="v">8:11</sup>And the name of the
star was called Bitterness. And a third part of the waters became
bitter, and many men died by the waters, because they were
bitter.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">8:12</sup>And the fourth angel
sounded; and a third part of the sun was smitten, and a third part
of the moon, and a third part of the stars, and a third part of
them were darkened, and the day did not appear a third part of it,
nor the night. <sup class="v">8:13</sup>And I saw, and heard an
eagle flying in the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe,
woe, woe, to those who live on the earth on account of the other
voices of the trumpet of the three angels who are about to
sound.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">9:1</sup>And the fifth angel
sounded; and I saw a star fall from heaven to the earth, and there
was given him the key of the pit of the abyss. <sup class=
"v">9:2</sup>And he opened the pit of the abyss; and there arose up
a smoke from the pit, like the smoke of a great furnace, and the
sun and the air were darkened by the smoke of the pit. <sup class=
"v">9:3</sup>And from the smoke went out locusts on the earth, and
power was given them like the power which scorpions of the earth
have. <sup class="v">9:4</sup>And it was told them not to injure
the grass of the earth nor any green thing nor any tree, but the
men who had not the seal of God on their foreheads. <sup class=
"v">9:5</sup>And it was given them not to kill them, but to sting
them five months; and their sting was like the sting of a scorpion,
when he strikes a man. <sup class="v">9:6</sup>And in those days
men shall seek death and not find it, and shall desire to die and
death flee from them.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">9:7</sup>And the forms of the
locusts were like horses prepared for battle, and upon their heads
were as it were crowns like gold, and their faces were like the
faces of men, <sup class="v">9:8</sup>and they had hair like the
hair of women, and their teeth were like [those] of lions,
<sup class="v">9:9</sup>and they had cuirasses like steel
cuirasses, and the sound of their wings was like the sound of
chariots with many horses running to battle. <sup class=
"v">9:10</sup>And they had tails like scorpions and stings, and in
their tails was their power to injure men five months. <sup class=
"v">9:11</sup>They had over them a king, an angel of the abyss,
whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon, but in the Greek he is called
Apollyon. <sup class="v">9:12</sup>One woe has passed; behold,
there come yet two woes after this.</p>
<p class="pin">8 <sup class="v">9:13</sup>And the sixth angel
sounded; and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden
altar before God, <sup class="v">9:14</sup>saying to the sixth
angel who had the trumpet, Unbind the four angels bound by the
river, the great Euphrates. <sup class="v">9:15</sup>And the four
angels were unbound, who were prepared for the hour, and day, and
month, and year, to kill a third part of men. <sup class=
"v">9:16</sup>And the number of the armies of the horse was two ten
thousands of ten thousands; I heard the number of them. <sup class=
"v">9:17</sup>And thus I saw the horses in the vision and those
sitting on them, having cuirassess of fire, of hyacinth and of
sulphur; and the heads of the horses were like the heads of lions,
and from their mouths proceeded fire and smoke and sulphur.</p>
<p class="pin">9 <sup class="v">9:18</sup>By these three plagues
a third part of men were killed, by the fire and the smoke and the
sulphur which proceeded from their mouths. <sup class=
"v">9:19</sup>For the power of the horses was in their mouths and
in their tails; for their tails were like serpents, having heads,
and with them they did injury. <sup class="v">9:20</sup>And the
rest of men, who were not killed with these plagues, did not change
their minds [to turn] from the works of their hands, not to worship
demons and idols of gold and silver and brass and stone and wood,
which cannot see nor hear nor walk, <sup class="v">9:21</sup>and
did not change their minds [to turn] from their murders, nor from
their magic arts, nor from their fornication, nor from their
thefts.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<h3>THE LITTLE BOOK AND THE TWO WITNESSES.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">10:1</sup>AND I saw another
mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed with a cloud, and an
iris was about his head, and his face was like the sun, and his
feet like pillars of fire, <sup class="v">10:2</sup>and he had in
his hand a little book opened. And he set his right foot on the
sea, and his left on the land, <sup class="v">10:3</sup>and cried
with a loud voice, as a lion roars. And when he cried, seven
thunders spoke their words. <sup class="v">10:4</sup>And when the
seven thunders spoke, I was about to write; and I heard a voice
from heaven, saying, Seal up what the seven thunders spoke, and
write it not.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">10:5</sup>And the angel whom I
saw standing on the sea and on the land, lifted up his right hand
to heaven, <sup class="v">10:6</sup>and swore by him that lives
forever and ever, that created heaven and the things in it and the
earth and the things in it and the sea and the things in it, that
time should be no longer, <sup class="v">10:7</sup>but in the days
of the sounding of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound,
then the mystery of God shall be finished, as he told his servants
the prophets.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">10:8</sup>And the voice which I
heard from heaven [I heard] again speak to me and say, Go and take
the little opened book in the hand of the angel who stands on the
sea and on the land. <sup class="v">10:9</sup>And I went to the
angel, and said to him, Give me the little book. And he said to me,
Take and eat it, and it will embitter your stomach, but in your
mouth it will be sweet as honey. <sup class="v">10:10</sup>And I
took the little book from the hand of the angel and eat it; and it
was in my mouth as sweet as honey; and when I eat it, my stomach
was bitter. <sup class="v">10:11</sup>And they said to me, You must
prophesy again before peoples and nations and tongues and many
kings.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">11:1</sup>And a rod was given me
like a staff, and he said, Arise and measure the temple of God and
the altar and those that worship in it. <sup class=
"v">11:2</sup>And leave out the exterior court of the temple and
measure it not, for it has been given to the gentiles, and they
shall tread the holy city under foot forty-two months [three years
and a half]. <sup class="v">11:3</sup>And I will give charge to my
two witnesses, and they shall prophesy twelve hundred and sixty
days [three years and a half] clothed with sackcloth. <sup class=
"v">11:4</sup>These are the two olive trees, and the two lamps,
which stand before the Lord of the earth. <sup class=
"v">11:5</sup>And if any one will injure them, fire proceeds from
their mouth and devours their adversaries; and if any one will
injure them, he must thus be killed. <sup class="v">11:6</sup>These
have power to shut heaven, that it may not rain in the days of
their prophecy, and they have power over the waters to turn them
into blood and to smite the earth with every plague as often as
they will.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">11:7</sup>And when they shall
finish their testimony, the beast which ascends from the abyss
shall make war with them, and conquer them, and kill them.
<sup class="v">11:8</sup>And their dead bodies shall lie in the
streets of the great city, which is spiritually called Sodom and
Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified. <sup class=
"v">11:9</sup>And the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations
shall see their dead bodies three days and a half, and shall not
permit their dead bodies to be buried. <sup class=
"v">11:10</sup>And those that dwell on the earth shall be glad, and
rejoice over them, and shall send gifts one to another, because
these two prophets tormented those that dwell on the earth.
<sup class="v">11:11</sup>And after three days and a half the
spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood on their
feet, and great fear fell on those that saw them. <sup class=
"v">11:12</sup>And I heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them,
Ascend hither; and they ascended to heaven in a cloud, and their
enemies beheld them. <sup class="v">11:13</sup>And in that hour
there was a great earthquake, and a tenth part of the city fell,
and seven thousand men were killed by the earthquake, and the rest
were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven. <sup class=
"v">11:14</sup>The second woe has passed; behold, the third woe
comes quickly.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<h3>THE SEVENTH TRUMPET, THE WOMAN, THE DRAGON AND THE BEASTS.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">11:15</sup>AND the seventh angel
sounded; and there were loud voices in heaven, saying, the kingdom
of the world has become our Lord's and his Christ's, and he shall
reign forever and ever. <sup class="v">11:16</sup>And the
twenty-four elders who sit before God on their thrones fell on
their faces, and worshipped God, <sup class="v">11:17</sup>saying,
We thank thee, Lord God Almighty, the Is and the Was, that thou
didst take thy great power and reign, <sup class="v">11:18</sup>and
the nations were angry, and thy wrath came, and the time of the
dead to be judged and to give the reward to thy servants the
prophets and to the saints and those that fear thy name, small and
great, and to destroy those that destroy the earth.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">11:19</sup>And the temple of God
was opened in heaven, and the ark of his covenant appeared in his
temple, and there were lightnings and voices and thunders and great
hail.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">12:1</sup>And a great symbol
appeared in heaven, a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon
under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars,
<sup class="v">12:2</sup>and being with child she cried out in pain
and distress to give it birth. <sup class="v">12:3</sup>And there
appeared another symbol in heaven, and behold, a great fiery
dragon, having seven heads and ten horns and upon his heads seven
diadems, <sup class="v">12:4</sup>and his tail drew a third of the
stars of heaven, and cast them on the earth. And the dragon stood
before the woman who was about to bear [a child], that when she had
borne he might devour her son. <sup class="v">12:5</sup>And she
bore a male child, who is about to rule all nations with a rod of
iron; and her child was caught up to God, and to his throne.
<sup class="v">12:6</sup>And the woman fled into the wilderness,
where she has a place prepared by God, that they may nourish her
there twelve hundred and sixty days [three years and a half].</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">12:7</sup>And there was a war in
heaven, Michael and his angels fighting with the dragon. And the
dragon fought and his angels, <sup class="v">12:8</sup>and were not
strong, neither was their place found any longer in heaven.
<sup class="v">12:9</sup>And the great dragon, the old serpent, who
is called the devil and Satan, and who deceives all the world, was
cast to the earth, and his angels were cast [to the earth] with
him. <sup class="v">12:10</sup>And I heard a loud voice in heaven
saying, Now has come the salvation and power and kingdom of our
God, and the power of his Christ, for the accuser of the brothers,
that accused them day and night before God, has been cast [to the
earth]. <sup class="v">12:11</sup>And they conquered him by the
blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, and exposed
their lives to death. <sup class="v">12:12</sup>Therefore rejoice,
heavens, and those who dwell in them; woe to the earth and the sea,
for the devil has come down to you, having great anger, knowing
that he has a short time.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">12:13</sup>And when the dragon
saw that he was cast to the earth, he persecuted the woman who bore
the male child. <sup class="v">12:14</sup>And there were given to
the woman two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly to the
wilderness to her place, where she is nourished a time and times
and half a time [three years and a half], from before the serpent.
<sup class="v">12:15</sup>And the serpent cast out of his mouth
after the woman water like a river, that he might carry her away.
<sup class="v">12:16</sup>And the earth helped the woman, and the
earth opened her mouth and swallowed up the river which the dragon
cast out of his mouth. <sup class="v">12:17</sup>And the dragon was
angry with the woman, and went to make war with the rest of her
children who keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony
of Jesus.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">13:1</sup>And I stood on the sand
of the sea. And I saw a beast come up out of the sea, having ten
horns and seven heads, and upon his horns ten diadems, and upon his
heads names of blasphemy. <sup class="v">13:2</sup>And the beast
which I saw was like a leopard, and his feet like those of a bear,
and his mouth like the mouth of a lion. And the dragon gave him his
power and his throne and great authority. <sup class=
"v">13:3</sup>And one of his heads [was as if] mortally wounded,
and its mortal wound was healed. And all the earth wondered after
the beast, <sup class="v">13:4</sup>and they worshipped the dragon,
because he gave power to the beast, and worshipped the beast,
saying, Who is like the beast, and who is able to make war with
him? <sup class="v">13:5</sup>And there was given him a mouth
speaking great things and blasphemy, and power was given him to
continue forty-two months [three years and a half]. <sup class=
"v">13:6</sup>And he opened his mouth in blasphemies against God,
to blaspheme his name and his tabernacle and those that dwell in
heaven. <sup class="v">13:7</sup>And it was given him to make war
with the saints and to conquer them, and power was given him over
every tribe and people and tongue and nation. <sup class=
"v">13:8</sup>And all who dwell on the earth shall worship him,
[every one] whose name is not enrolled in the Lamb's book of life
who was killed from the foundation of the world. <sup class=
"v">13:9</sup>If any one has an ear let him hear. <sup class=
"v">13:10</sup>If any one [leads] into captivity, he shall go into
captivity; if any one kills with the sword, he shall be killed with
the sword. Here is the patience and faith of the saints.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">13:11</sup>And I saw another
beast come up out of the earth, and he had two horns like a lamb
and spoke like a dragon. <sup class="v">13:12</sup>And he exercised
all the power of the first beast in his presence. And he caused the
earth and those that dwell in it to worship the first beast, whose
mortal wound was healed. <sup class="v">13:13</sup>And he performs
great miracles, so as even to make fire come down from heaven to
the earth in the sight of men. <sup class="v">13:14</sup>And he
deceives those that dwell on the earth by the miracles which it was
given him to perform before the beast, telling those that dwell on
the earth to make an image of the beast which had the wound with
the sword and lived. <sup class="v">13:15</sup>And it was given him
to give a spirit to the image of the beast, that the image of the
beast should both speak, and cause that all who would not worship
the image of the beast should be killed. <sup class=
"v">13:16</sup>And he caused all, small and great, and rich and
poor, and freemen and servants, to receive the mark on their right
hand or on their forehead, <sup class="v">13:17</sup>and that no
one should buy or sell unless he had the mark, the name of the
beast or the number of his name. <sup class="v">13:18</sup>Here is
wisdom. Let him that has a mind count the number of the beast; for
the number is man's. And his number is six hundred and
sixty-six.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<h3>THE LAMB ON MOUNT ZION, AND HIS JUDGMENTS.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">14:1</sup>AND I saw, and behold,
the Lamb stood on Mount Zion, and with him a hundred and forty-four
thousand having his name and the name of his father written on
their foreheads. <sup class="v">14:2</sup>And I heard a voice from
heaven like the sound of many waters and like the sound of loud
thunder, and the voice which I heard was like harpers playing on
their harps. <sup class="v">14:3</sup>And they sung a new song
before the throne and before the four cherubs and the elders; and
no one could learn the song except the hundred and forty-four
thousand, who had been redeemed from the earth. <sup class=
"v">14:4</sup>These are they who were not defiled with women; for
they are virgins; these are those who follow the Lamb wherever he
goes. These were redeemed from men a first fruit to God and the
Lamb, <sup class="v">14:5</sup>and in their mouth was found no
deceit; for they are blameless.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">14:6</sup>And I saw another angel
flying in mid-heaven, having the eternal gospel to preach to those
who dwell on the earth and to every nation and tribe and tongue and
people, <sup class="v">14:7</sup>saying with a loud voice, Fear God
and give him glory, for the hour of his judgment has come, and
worship him that made heaven and the earth and the sea and
fountains of waters.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">14:8</sup>And another, a second
angel, followed, saying, Babylon the great has fallen, who made all
nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">14:9</sup>And another, a third
angel, followed them, saying with a loud voice, if any one worships
the beast and his image, and receives the mark on his forehead or
on his hand, <sup class="v">14:10</sup>he shall drink of the wine
of the wrath of God, mingled undiluted in the cup of his
indignation, and he shall be tormented with fire and sulphur before
the angels and before the Lamb. <sup class="v">14:11</sup>And the
smoke of their torment rises up forever and ever, and they have no
rest day nor night who worship the beast and his image, and whoever
receives the mark of his name. <sup class="v">14:12</sup>Here is
the patience of the saints, who keep the commandments of God and
the faith of Jesus. <sup class="v">14:13</sup>And I heard a voice
from heaven, saying, Write, Blessed are the dead who die in the
Lord from henceforth. Yes, says the Spirit, they shall rest from
their labors; and their works follow after them.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">14:14</sup>And I saw, and behold,
a white cloud, and on the cloud one sitting like the Son of man,
having on his head a crown of gold and in his hand a sharp sickle.
<sup class="v">14:15</sup>And another angel came out of the temple,
crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, Send your
sickle and reap, for the time has come to harvest, for the harvest
of the earth is dry. <sup class="v">14:16</sup>And he that sat on
the cloud cast his sickle upon the earth, and the earth was
harvested.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">14:17</sup>And another angel came
out of the temple in heaven, and he had a sharp sickle; <sup class=
"v">14:18</sup>and another angel came out from the altar, who had
power over fire, and cried with a loud voice to him who had the
sharp sickle, saying, Send your sharp sickle and gather the grapes
of the vine of the earth, for its grapes are ripe. <sup class=
"v">14:19</sup>And the angel cast his sharp sickle on the earth,
and gathered the vine of the earth and cast it into the great
wine-press of the wrath of God. <sup class="v">14:20</sup>And the
wine-press was trodden without the city, and the blood went out
from the wine-press to the horses' bridles, a distance of sixteen
hundred stadia [158 English miles].</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<h3>THE LAST SEVEN PLAGUES OF THE KINGDOM OF THE BEAST.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">15:1</sup>AND I saw another
symbol in heaven, great and wonderful, seven angels having the last
seven plagues, because by them the wrath of God was finished.
<sup class="v">15:2</sup>And I saw as it were a sea of glass
mingled with fire, and those becoming victors over the beast and
his image and the number of his name standing on the sea of glass,
having harps of God. <sup class="v">15:3</sup>And they sing the
song of Moses the servant of God and the song of the Lamb, saying,
Great and wonderful are thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true
are thy ways, king of the nations; <sup class="v">15:4</sup>who
shall not fear thee, Lord, and glorify thy name? For thou only art
holy, for all the nations shall come and worship before thee, for
thy righteous ordinances have been made manifest.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">15:5</sup>And after this I saw,
and the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony was opened in
heaven, [the inner temple], <sup class="v">15:6</sup>and the seven
angels went out who have the last seven plagues, clothed with pure
bright linen, and girded about the breasts with golden girdles.
<sup class="v">15:7</sup>And one of the four cherubs gave the seven
angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of the God who lives
forever and ever. <sup class="v">15:8</sup>And the temple was
filled with smoke from the glory of God and from his power, and no
one could enter into the temple till the seven plagues of the seven
angels were finished.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">16:1</sup>And I heard a loud
voice saying to the seven angels, Go, pour out the seven bowls of
the wrath of God on the earth. <sup class="v">16:2</sup>And the
first went and poured out his bowl on the earth; and there was an
evil and malignant ulcer on the men who have the mark of the beast
and those who worship his image.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">16:3</sup>And the second poured
out his bowl on the sea; and it became as the blood of a dead body,
and every living soul died, the [creatures] in the sea.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">16:4</sup>And the third poured
out his bowl on the rivers and the fountains of waters; and they
became blood. <sup class="v">16:5</sup>And I heard the angel of the
waters say, Thou art just, the Is and the Was, [the] Holy One,
because thou hast judged thus, <sup class="v">16:6</sup>for they
shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them
blood to drink; they are worthy. <sup class="v">16:7</sup>And I
heard the altar say, Yes, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous are
thy judgments.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">16:8</sup>And the fourth poured
out his bowl on the sun, and it was given it to scorch men with
fire. <sup class="v">16:9</sup>And men were scorched with great
heat, and blasphemed the name of God who had power over these
plagues, and changed not their minds to give him glory.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">16:10</sup>And the fifth poured
out his bowl on the throne of the beast; and his kingdom was
darkened, and they gnawed their tongues from painful labor,
<sup class="v">16:11</sup>and blasphemed the God of heaven on
account of their painful labors and their ulcers, and they changed
not their minds to turn from their works.</p>
<p class="pin">8 <sup class="v">16:12</sup>And the sixth poured
out his bowl on the river, the great Euphrates; and its water was
dried up, that the way of the kings from the East might be
prepared. <sup class="v">16:13</sup>And I saw three impure spirits
like frogs [proceed] from the mouth of the dragon and from the
mouth of the beast and from the mouth of the false prophet;&mdash;
<sup class="v">16:14</sup>for [these] are spirits of demons that
perform miracles, that go to the kings of all the world, to
assemble them for the battle of that great day of God Almighty.
<sup class="v">16:15</sup>Behold, I come as a thief; blessed is he
that watches and keeps on his clothes, lest he walk naked and they
see his shame. <sup class="v">16:16</sup>And they assembled them in
the place called in Hebrew Armagedon.</p>
<p class="pin">9 <sup class="v">16:17</sup>And the seventh angel
poured out his bowl on the air; and there came out a loud voice
from the temple, from the throne, saying, It is done. <sup class=
"v">16:18</sup>And there were lightnings and voices and thunders,
and there was a great earthquake, such as has not been since a man
was on the earth, such an earthquake and one so great. <sup class=
"v">16:19</sup>And the great city was divided into three parts, and
the cities of the nations fell. And Babylon the great was
remembered before God, to give her the cup of the wine of his
indignant wrath. <sup class="v">16:20</sup>And every island fled,
and the mountains were not found. <sup class="v">16:21</sup>And
great hail of about the weight of a talent [the Attic talent, 56
pounds, the Jewish, 113] came down from heaven upon men; and men
blasphemed God on account of the plague of the hail because its
plague was very great.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>
<h3>THE FALL OF BABYLON.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">17:1</sup>AND one of the seven
angels having the seven bowls came and spoke to me, saying, Come, I
will show you the judgment of the great harlot who sits on many
waters, <sup class="v">17:2</sup>with whom the kings of the earth
have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth were
made drunk with the wine of her fornication.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">17:3</sup>And he bore me away
into the wilderness in the Spirit. And I saw a woman sitting on a
scarlet beast, [the beast] full of blasphemous names, having seven
heads and ten horns. <sup class="v">17:4</sup>And the woman was
clothed in purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and precious
stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of
abominations and the impurities of the fornication of the earth,
<sup class="v">17:5</sup>and on her forehead the names inscribed,
MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND OF THE
ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH. <sup class="v">17:6</sup>And I saw the
woman drunk with the blood of the saints and the blood of the
martyrs of Jesus, and I wondered when I saw her with great
wonder.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">17:7</sup>And the angel said to
me, Why did you wonder? I will tell you the mystery of the woman
and of the beast which carries her, having the seven heads and ten
horns. <sup class="v">17:8</sup>The beast which you saw was and is
not, and is about to come up from the abyss, and goes to
destruction; and those who live on the earth, whose names are not
written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, will
wonder, when they see the beast that he was and is not and is to
come. <sup class="v">17:9</sup>Here is the mind which has wisdom.
The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sits,
<sup class="v">17:10</sup>and are seven kings; five have fallen,
one is, the other has not yet come, and when he comes must continue
a short time. <sup class="v">17:11</sup>And the beast which was and
is not, he also is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goes to
destruction.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">17:12</sup>And the ten horns
which you saw are ten kings, which have not yet received a kingdom,
but receive power as kings one hour with the beast. <sup class=
"v">17:13</sup>These have one will, and give their power and their
authority to the beast. <sup class="v">17:14</sup>They shall make
war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall conquer them,&mdash;for he is
Lord of lords and King of kings, and those with him are called and
chosen and faithful. <sup class="v">17:15</sup>And he said to me,
The waters which you saw, where the harlot sits, are peoples and
multitudes and nations and tongues. <sup class="v">17:16</sup>And
the ten horns which you saw and the beast shall hate the harlot,
and make her desolate and naked, and eat her flesh, and burn her
with fire; <sup class="v">17:17</sup>for God has put it into their
hearts to do his will and to have one will and give their kingdom
to the beast, till the words of God are finished. <sup class=
"v">17:18</sup>And the woman which you saw is the great city which
reigns over the kings of the earth.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">18:1</sup>After this I saw
another angel come down from heaven, having great power, and the
earth was lighted by his glory. <sup class="v">18:2</sup>And he
cried with a loud voice, saving, Babylon the great has fallen, has
fallen, and has become a habitation of demons, and a haunt of every
impure spirit, and a haunt of every impure and hateful bird,
<sup class="v">18:3</sup>because all nations have drank of the wine
of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth
committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth
became rich from the greatness of her luxury.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">18:4</sup>And I heard another
voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that you may
not partake of her sins, and receive of her plagues; <sup class=
"v">18:5</sup>for her sins have reached to heaven and God has
remembered her wickedness. <sup class="v">18:6</sup>Render to her
as she rendered to you, and repay her double according to her
works; of the cup that she has mixed, mix to her double;
<sup class="v">18:7</sup>as much as she glorified herself, and
lived luxuriously, so much distress and sorrow give her. For she
says in her mind, I sit a queen and am not a widow and I see not
sorrow. <sup class="v">18:8</sup>Therefore in one day shall her
plagues come, death and sorrow and famine, and she shall be burnt
with fire; for mighty is the Lord God who has judged her.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">18:9</sup>And the kings of the
earth who committed fornication and lived luxuriously with her
shall weep and lament for her, when they see the smoke of her
burning, <sup class="v">18:10</sup>standing at a distance on
account of fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas, the great city,
Babylon the mighty city, for in one hour your judgment has come.
<sup class="v">18:11</sup>And the merchants of the earth shall weep
and lament for her, because no one buys their wares any more,
<sup class="v">18:12</sup>wares of gold and silver and precious
stones and pearls, and linen and purple and silk and scarlet, and
all thyine wood, and every implement of ivory and every implement
of most precious wood, of brass and iron and marble, <sup class=
"v">18:13</sup>cinnamon and amomum and incense and ointment and
frankincense, and wine and oil and fine flour and wheat and cattle
and sheep, and of horses and chariots and servants, and souls of
men. <sup class="v">18:14</sup>And the fruit of your soul's desire
has gone from you, and all precious and shining stores have
perished from you, and you shall find them no more.</p>
<p class="pin">8 <sup class="v">18:15</sup>And dealers in these
things, and those who became rich by her, shall stand afar off for
fear of her distress, weeping and lamenting, <sup class=
"v">18:16</sup>saying, Alas, alas, the great city, that was clothed
with fine linen and purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and
precious stones and pearls, <sup class="v">18:17</sup>for in one
hour are so great riches made a desolation. And every
sailing-master and every one who sails to the place, and sailors
and all that work on the sea, shall stand afar off, <sup class=
"v">18:18</sup>and looking on the smoke of its burning, cry,
saying, What city is like this great city? <sup class=
"v">18:19</sup>And they shall cast dust on their heads, and cry
weeping and lamenting, saying, Alas, alas, the great city, by which
all were enriched who had ships on the sea on account of her costly
merchandise, for in one hour is it made desolate. <sup class=
"v">18:20</sup>Rejoice over her, heaven, and you holy angels and
apostles and prophets, for God has executed your judgment on
her.</p>
<p class="pin">9 <sup class="v">18:21</sup>And a mighty angel
took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast it into the sea,
saying, Thus with violence shall Babylon the great city be cast
down, and shall be found no more. <sup class="v">18:22</sup>And the
voice of harpers and singers and of those that play on flutes and
trumpets shall be heard in you no more. And no artisan of any art
shall be found in you any more, and the sound of a mill shall be
heard in you no more, <sup class="v">18:23</sup>and the light of a
candle shall shine in you no more, and the voice of a bridegroom
and of a bride shall be heard in you no more, for your merchants
were the great ones of the earth, for all nations were deceived by
your magic arts, <sup class="v">18:24</sup>and in her was found the
blood of prophets and saints, and of all that have been killed on
the earth.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
<h3>SATAN CONQUERED AND IMPRISONED, HIS RELEASE AND FINAL
OVERTHROW.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">19:1</sup>AFTER this I heard a
loud voice as of a great multitude in heaven, saying, Halleluia,
the salvation and glory and power of our God, <sup class=
"v">19:2</sup>for true and righteous are his judgments, for he has
judged the great harlot who destroyed the earth with her
fornication, and avenged the blood of his servants at her hand.
<sup class="v">19:3</sup>And again they said, Halleluia, and her
smoke ascends forever and ever. <sup class="v">19:4</sup>And the
twenty-four elders fell down, and the four cherubs, and worshipped
God who sat on the throne, saying, Amen, Halleluia. <sup class=
"v">19:5</sup>And a voice came out from the throne, saying, Praise
our God, all his servants and those that fear him, small and great.
<sup class="v">19:6</sup>And I heard them as the voice of a great
multitude, and as the sound of many waters and as the sound of
mighty thunders, saying, Halleluia, for the Lord our God the
Almighty reigns. <sup class="v">19:7</sup>Let us rejoice and be
glad, and give glory to him, for the marriage of the Lamb has come
and his wife has prepared herself, <sup class="v">19:8</sup>and it
was given her to be arrayed in fine linen white and
clean;&mdash;for fine linen represents the righteous ordinances of
the saints.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">19:9</sup>And he said to me,
Write, Blessed are those who are called to the wedding supper of
the Lamb. And he told me, These are the true words of God.
<sup class="v">19:10</sup>And I fell before his feet to worship
him. And he said to me, See [that you do it] not; I am your
fellow-servant and of your brothers who have the testimony of
Jesus; worship God. For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of
prophecy.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">19:11</sup>And I saw heaven
opened, and behold, a white horse, and he that sat on it is called
faithful and true, and in righteousness he judges and makes war.
<sup class="v">19:12</sup>And his eyes are a flame of fire, and on
his head are many diadems; he has a name written that no man knows
except himself, <sup class="v">19:13</sup>and he is clothed in a
mantle dipped in blood, and his name is called The Word of God.
<sup class="v">19:14</sup>And the armies of heaven follow him upon
white horses, clothed with fine white clean linen. <sup class=
"v">19:15</sup>And out of his mouth proceeds a sharp sword, that
with it he may smite the nations; and he shall rule them with a rod
of iron, and he shall tread the wine-press of the indignant wrath
of God Almighty. <sup class="v">19:16</sup>And he has on the mantle
and on the thigh his name written, King of kings and Lord of
lords.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">19:17</sup>And I saw an angel
standing on the sun, and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all
the birds that fly in mid-heaven, Come, assemble yourselves to the
great supper of God, <sup class="v">19:18</sup>that you may eat the
flesh of kings and the flesh of chiliarchs and the flesh of mighty
[men] and the flesh of horses and of those who sit on them, and the
flesh of all, both free-men and servants and both small and great.
<sup class="v">19:19</sup>And I saw the beast and the kings of the
earth and their armies assembled together to make war with him that
sat on the horse and with his army. <sup class="v">19:20</sup>And
the beast was taken and with him the false prophet who performed
miracles before him, with which he deceived those who received the
mark of the beast and those who worship his image; and the two were
cast alive into the lake of fire burning with sulphur. <sup class=
"v">19:21</sup>And the rest were killed with the sword of him that
sits on the horse, which proceeded out of his mouth, and all the
birds were filled with their flesh.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">20:1</sup>And I saw an angel
descending from heaven, having the key of the abyss and a great
chain in his hand. <sup class="v">20:2</sup>And he took the dragon,
which is the old serpent, who is the devil and Satan, and bound him
a thousand years, <sup class="v">20:3</sup>and cast him into the
abyss, and shut him up and put a seal over him, that he should
deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years were finished;
after that he must be released a short time.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">20:4</sup>And I saw thrones, and
they sat on them, and judgment was given them, and the souls of
those who have been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus and the
word of God, and who did not worship the beast nor his image and
did not receive the mark on their forehead and on their right hand;
and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years;
<sup class="v">20:5</sup>the rest of the dead did not live till the
thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection.
<sup class="v">20:6</sup>Blessed and holy is he that has part in
the first resurrection; on these the second death has no power, but
they shall be priests of God and Christ, and reign with him a
thousand years.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">20:7</sup>And when the thousand
years are finished, Satan shall be released from his prison,
<sup class="v">20:8</sup>and go forth to deceive the nations which
are in the four quarters of the earth, the Gog and the Magog [the
king and the people], and to assemble them together to battle,
whose number is as the sand of the sea. <sup class=
"v">20:9</sup>And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and
surrounded the encampment of the saints and the beloved city; and
fire came down from heaven and consumed them. <sup class=
"v">20:10</sup>And the devil who deceived them was cast into the
lake of fire and sulphur, where also the beast and the false
prophet [were cast], and they shall be tormented day and night
forever and ever.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>
<h3>THE FINAL JUDGMENT, THE NEW JERUSALEM, ETC.</h3>
<p class="pin">1 <sup class="v">20:11</sup>AND I saw a great
white throne and him that sat on it, from whose presence the earth
and heaven fled away, and no place was found for them. <sup class=
"v">20:12</sup>And I saw the dead, great and small, stand before
the throne, and the books were opened; and another book was opened,
which is of life. And the dead were judged from the things written
in the books according to their works. <sup class=
"v">20:13</sup>And the sea gave up the dead who were in it, and
Death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them, and they were
judged each according to their works. <sup class="v">20:14</sup>And
Death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second
death, the lake of fire. <sup class="v">20:15</sup>And whoever was
not found enrolled in the book of life was cast into the lake of
fire.</p>
<p class="pin">2 <sup class="v">21:1</sup>And I saw a new heaven
and new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth passed
away, and the sea was no more. <sup class="v">21:2</sup>And I saw
the holy city New Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God,
prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. <sup class=
"v">21:3</sup>And I heard a loud voice from heaven, saying, Behold,
the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will tabernacle with
them, and they shall be his people, and God himself will be with
them, their God, <sup class="v">21:4</sup>and he will wipe away
every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, nor shall
lamentation nor crying nor pain be any more, for the former things
have passed away.</p>
<p class="pin">3 <sup class="v">21:5</sup>And he that sits on the
throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said, Write that
these words are faithful and true. <sup class="v">21:6</sup>And he
said to me, It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning
and the end. I will give to him that thirsts of the fountain of the
water of life freely. <sup class="v">21:7</sup>He that conquers
shall inherit these things, and I will be to him a God and he shall
be to me a son. <sup class="v">21:8</sup>But the fearful and
unbelieving and abominable and murderers and fornicators and
sorcerers and idolaters and all liars shall have their part in the
lake which burns with fire and sulphur, which is the second
death.</p>
<p class="pin">4 <sup class="v">21:9</sup>And one of the seven
angels who had the seven bowls full of the last seven plagues came,
and spoke with me, saying, Come, I will show you the wife, the
bride of the Lamb. <sup class="v">21:10</sup>And he bore me away in
the Spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me the city,
the holy Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, <sup class=
"v">21:11</sup>having the glory of God; its luminary was like the
most precious stone, like a crystalline jasper. <sup class=
"v">21:12</sup>It had a great and high wall, it had twelve gates,
and at the gates twelve angels, and names inscribed, which are the
names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel. <sup class=
"v">21:13</sup>On the east were three gates, and on the north three
gates, and on the south three gates, and on the west three gates.
<sup class="v">21:14</sup>And the wall of the city has twelve
foundations, and on them the twelve names of the twelve apostles of
the Lamb.</p>
<p class="pin">5 <sup class="v">21:15</sup>And he that spoke with
me had a golden measuring rod, to measure the city and its gates
and its wall. <sup class="v">21:16</sup>And the city was square,
and its length equal to its breadth. And he measured the city with
the rod, twelve thousand stadia [1372 English miles]; and the
length and breadth and height of it are equal. <sup class=
"v">21:17</sup>And he measured its wall, a hundred and forty-four
cubits, the measure of a man, which was of the angel. <sup class=
"v">21:18</sup>And the building of its wall was jasper, and the
city was of pure gold like clear glass. <sup class=
"v">21:19</sup>And the foundations of the wall of the city were
adorned with every precious stone; the first foundation was jasper,
the second sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald,
<sup class="v">21:20</sup>the fifth sardonyx, the sixth sardine
stone, the seventh chrysolyte, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz,
the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh hyacinth, and the twelfth
amethyst.</p>
<p class="pin">6 <sup class="v">21:21</sup>And the twelve gates
were twelve pearls; each of the gates was of one pearl. And the
street of the city was of pure gold, transparent as glass.
<sup class="v">21:22</sup>And I saw no temple in it, for the Lord
God Almighty is its temple, and the Lamb. <sup class=
"v">21:23</sup>And the city has no need of the sun, nor of the
moon, to give a light to it; for the glory of God lights it, and
its light the Lamb. <sup class="v">21:24</sup>And the nations shall
walk in its light, and the kings of the earth bring their glory to
it, <sup class="v">21:25</sup>and its gates shall not be shut by
day,&mdash;for there shall be no night there,&mdash; <sup class=
"v">21:26</sup>and they shall bring the glory and honor of the
nations into it. <sup class="v">21:27</sup>And there shall not
enter into it any thing that is defiled, nor any one that commits
an abomination and falsehood, but those enrolled in the Lamb's book
of life.</p>
<p class="pin">7 <sup class="v">22:1</sup>And he showed me a
river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding from the
throne of God and the Lamb. <sup class="v">22:2</sup>In the midst
of its broad plain and along the river on each side was the tree of
life, bearing twelve fruits, and yielding monthly each of its
fruits, and the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the
nations. <sup class="v">22:3</sup>And no curse shall be there any
more. And the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it, and his
servants shall serve him, <sup class="v">22:4</sup>and shall see
his face, and his name shall be on their foreheads. <sup class=
"v">22:5</sup>And there shall be no night, and they shall have no
need of a lamp and light, for the Lord God shall shed light on
them, and they shall reign forever and ever.</p>
<p class="pin">8 <sup class="v">22:6</sup>And he said to me,
These words are faithful and true, and the Lord God of the spirits
of the prophets sent his angel to show his servants what must
shortly occur. <sup class="v">22:7</sup>Behold, I come quickly.
Blessed is he that keeps the words of the prophecy of this
book.</p>
<p class="pin">9 <sup class="v">22:8</sup>And I am John who heard
and saw these thing; and when I heard and when I saw I fell down to
worship before the feet of the angel that showed me these things.
<sup class="v">22:9</sup>And he said to me, See [that you do it]
not; for I am your fellow servant and of your brothers the prophets
and of those that keep the words of this book; worship God.
<sup class="v">22:10</sup>And he said to me, Seal not up the words
of the prophecy of this book; the time is at hand. <sup class=
"v">22:11</sup>Let the unjust be unjust still, and let the filthy
be filthy still, and let the righteous do righteousness still, and
let the holy be made holy still.</p>
<p class="pin">10 <sup class="v">22:12</sup>Behold, I come
quickly, and my reward is with me, to give every one as his work
is. <sup class="v">22:13</sup>I am the Alpha and the Omega, first
and last, the beginning and end. <sup class="v">22:14</sup>Blessed
are they that keep his commandments, that they may have a right to
the tree of life, and enter by the gates into the city. <sup class=
"v">22:15</sup>Without are dogs and sorcerers, and fornicators, and
murderers and idolaters and whoever loves and practises
falsehood.</p>
<p class="pin">11 <sup class="v">22:16</sup>I Jesus sent my angel
to testify to you these things for the churches. I am the root and
offspring of David, and the bright star of the morning. <sup class=
"v">22:17</sup>And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him
that hears say, Come. And let him that thirsts, come; let him that
will, take the water of life freely.</p>
<p class="pin">12 <sup class="v">22:18</sup>I testify to every
one that hears the words of the prophecy of this book. If any one
adds to them, God shall add to him the plagues written in this
book; <sup class="v">22:19</sup>and if any one takes away from the
words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part
from the tree of life, and the holy city, described in this book.
<sup class="v">22:20</sup>He that testifies these things says, Yes,
I come quickly. Amen, come Lord Jesus. <sup class=
"v">22:21</sup>The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all.</p>
